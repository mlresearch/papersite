  title = {{Nonparametric Bayesian Factor Analysis for Dynamic Count Matrices}},
  author = {Acharya, Ayan and Ghosh, Joydeep and Zhou, Mingyuan},
  pages = {1-9},
  abstract = {A gamma process dynamic Poisson factor analysis model is proposed to factorize a dynamic count matrix, whose columns are sequentially observed count vectors. The model builds a novel  Markov chain that sends the latent gamma random variables at time (t-1) as the shape parameters of those at time t, which are linked to observed or latent counts under the Poisson likelihood.  The significant challenge of inferring the gamma shape parameters is fully addressed, using unique data augmentation and marginalization techniques for the negative binomial distribution. The same nonparametric Bayesian model also applies to the factorization of a dynamic binary matrix, via a Bernoulli-Poisson link that connects a binary observation to a latent count, with closed-form conditional posteriors for the latent counts and efficient computation for sparse observations. We apply the model to text and music analysis, with state-of-the-art results.}

  pages = {19-27},
  abstract = {The CUR matrix decomposition and the related Nystr\"{o}m  method build low-rank approximations of data matrices by selecting a small number of representative rows and columns of the data.  Here, we introduce novel \emph{spectral gap error bounds} that judiciously exploit the potentially rapid spectrum decay in the input matrix, a most common occurrence in machine learning and data analysis. Our error bounds are much tighter than existing ones for matrices with rapid spectrum decay, and they justify the use of a constant amount of oversampling relative to the rank parameter $k$, i.e, when the number of columns/rows is $\ell=k+ O(1)$.  We demonstrate our analysis on a novel deterministic algorithm, \emph{StableCUR}, which additionally eliminates a previously unrecognized source of potential instability in CUR decompositions.  While our algorithm accepts any method of row and column selection, we implement it with a recent column selection scheme with strong singular value bounds.  Empirical results on various classes of real world data matrices demonstrate that our algorithm is as efficient as and often outperforms competing algorithms.}

  author = {Atan, Onur and Tekin, Cem and van der Schaar, Mihaela},
  pages = {28-36},
  abstract = {Standard Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problems assume that the arms are independent. However, in many application scenarios, the information obtained by playing an arm provides information about the remainder of the arms. Hence, in such applications, this informativeness can and should be exploited to enable faster convergence to the optimal solution. In this paper, formalize a new class of multi-armed bandit methods, Global Multi-armed Bandit (GMAB), in which arms are globally informative through a global parameter, i.e., choosing an arm reveals information about all the arms. We propose a greedy policy for the GMAB which always selects the arm with the highest estimated expected reward, and prove that it achieves bounded parameter-dependent regret. Hence, this policy selects suboptimal arms only finitely many times, and after a finite number of initial time steps, the optimal arm is selected in all of the remaining time steps with probability one. In addition, we also study how the informativeness of the arms about each other’s rewards affects the speed of learning. Specifically, we prove that the parameter-free (worst-case) regret is sublinear in time, and decreases with the infor- mativeness of the arms. We also prove a sublinear in time Bayesian risk bound for the GMAB which reduces to the well-known Bayesian risk bound for linearly parameterized bandits when the arms are fully informa- tive. GMABs have applications ranging from drug dosage control to dynamic pricing.}

Specifically, we consider a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with two non-spherical Gaussian components, where the clusters are distinguished by only a few relevant dimensions. The method we propose is a combination of a recent approach for learning parameters of a Gaussian mixture model and sparse linear discriminant analysis (LDA). In addition to cluster assignments, the method returns an estimate of the set of features relevant for clustering. Our results indicate that the sample complexity of clustering depends on the sparsity of the relevant feature set, while only scaling logarithmically with the ambient dimension. Further, we require much milder assumptions than existing work on clustering in high dimensions. In particular, we do not require spherical clusters nor necessitate mean separation along relevant dimensions.}

This allows us to combine the advantages of each into a single MAP inference technique: solving the local consistency relaxation with any of a number of highly scalable message-passing algorithms, and then obtaining a high-quality discrete solution via a guaranteed rounding procedure when the relaxation is not tight. Logical MRFs are a general class of models that can incorporate many common dependencies, such as logical implications and mixtures of supermodular and submodular potentials. They can be used for many structured prediction tasks, including natural language processing, computer vision, and computational social science. We show that our new inference technique can improve solution quality by as much as 20% without sacrificing speed on problems with over one million dependencies.}

  abstract = {We give an efficient algorithm for finding sparse approximate solutions to linear systems of  equations with nonnegative coefficients. Unlike most known results for sparse recovery, we do not require _any_ assumption on the matrix other than non-negativity. Our algorithm is combinatorial in nature, inspired by techniques for the "set cover" problem, as well as the multiplicative weight update method.   We then present a natural application to learning mixture models in the PAC framework. For learning a mixture of k axis-aligned Gaussians in d dimensions, we give an algorithm that outputs a mixture of O(k/\epsilon^3) Gaussians that is \epsilon-close in statistical distance to the true distribution, without any separation assumptions. The time and sample complexity is roughly O(kd/\epsilon^3)^d. This is polynomial when 'd' is constant -- precisely the regime in which known methods fail to identify the components efficiently.  Given that non-negativity is a natural assumption, we believe that our result may find use in other settings in which we wish to approximately "explain" data using a small number of a (large) candidate set of components.}

  pages = {93-101},
  abstract = {Databases in domains such as healthcare are routinely released to the public in aggregated form. Unfortunately, naive modeling with aggregated data may significantly diminish the accuracy of inferences at the individual level. This paper addresses the scenario where features are provided at the individual level, but the target variables are only available as histogram aggregates or order statistics. We consider a limiting case of generalized linear modeling when the target variables are only known up to permutation, and explore how this relates to permutation testing; a standard technique for assessing statistical dependency. Based on this relationship, we propose a simple algorithm to estimate the model parameters and individual level inferences via alternating imputation and standard generalized linear model fitting. Our results suggest the effectiveness of the proposed approach when, in the original data, permutation testing accurately ascertains the veracity of the linear relationship. The framework is extended to general histogram data with larger bins - with order statistics such as the median as a limiting case. Our experimental results on simulated data and aggregated healthcare data suggest a diminishing returns property with respect to the granularity of the histogram - when a linear relationship holds in the original data, the targets can be predicted accurately given relatively coarse histograms.}

Annealed importance sampling (AIS) is widely used to estimate MRF partition functions, and often yields quite accurate results. However, AIS is prone to overestimate the log-likelihood with little indication that anything is wrong. We present the Reverse AIS Estimator (RAISE), a stochastic lower bound on the log-likelihood of an approximation to the original MRF model. RAISE requires only the same MCMC transition operators as standard AIS. Experimental results indicate that RAISE agrees closely with AIS log-probability estimates for RBMs, DBMs, and DBNs, but typically errs on the side of underestimating, rather than overestimating, the log-likelihood.}

To this end, we first derive upper bounds on the RBM cost function, then show that descent methods can have natural ad- vantages by operating in the L\infty and Shatten-\infty norm. We introduce a new method called “Stochastic Spectral Descent” that updates parameters in the normed space. Empirical results show dramatic improvements over stochastic gradient descent, and have only have a fractional increase on the per-iteration cost.}

However, the performance of the system is judged on the entire ranked list. We provide a comprehensive set of results regarding learnability under this challenging setting. For PairwiseLoss and DCG, two popular ranking measures, we prove that the minimax regret is $\Theta(T^{2/3})$. Moreover, the minimax regret is achievable using an efficient strategy that only spends $O(m \log m)$ time per round. The same efficient strategy achieves $O(T^{2/3})$ regret for Precision@$k$. Surprisingly, we show that for normalized versions of these ranking measures, i.e., AUC, NDCG \& MAP, no online ranking algorithm can have sublinear regret.}

We establish consistency and recovery guarantees of the estimator for both Gaussian and sub-Gaussian random measurements. For Gaussian measurements, our estimator is comparable to the best known in the literature, along with guarantees on support recovery. For sub-Gaussian measurements, our estimator has an irreducible error which, unlike existing results, can be controlled by scaling the measurement vectors. In both cases, our analysis covers the setting of model misspecification, i.e., when the true sparsity is unknown. Experimental results illustrate several strengths of the new estimator.}

  pages = {147-155},
  abstract = {Conditional random fields (CRFs) are an important class of models for accurate structured prediction, but effective design of the feature functions is a major challenge when applying CRF models to real world data. Gradient boosting, which is used to automatically induce and select feature functions, is a natural candidate solution to the problem.  However, it is non-trivial to derive gradient boosting algorithms for CRFs due to the dense Hessian matrices introduced by variable dependencies. Existing approaches thus use only first-order information when optimizing likelihood, and hence face convergence issues. We incorporate second-order information by deriving a Markov Chain mixing rate bound to quantify the dependencies, and introduce a gradient boosting algorithm that iteratively optimizes an adaptive upper bound of the objective function.  The resulting algorithm induces and selects features for CRFs via functional space optimization, with provable convergence guarantees.  Experimental results on three real world datasets demonstrate that the mixing rate based upper bound is effective for learning CRFs with non-linear potentials.}

However, in many cases, users may be interested in an anytime algorithm that can offer a flexible trade-off between computation time and optimality guarantees. In this paper, we propose a filtered search (FS) framework that allows the user to set an arbitrary approximation bound guarantee with a “tunable knob”, from 0 (arbitrarily bad) to 1 (globally optimal). FS naturally handles monotone and non-monotone functions as well as unconstrained problems and problems with cardinality, matroid, and knapsack constraints. Further, it can also be applied to (non-negative) non-submodular functions and still gives controllable approximation bounds based on their submodularity ratio. Finally,  FS encompasses the greedy algorithm as a special case. Our framework is based on theory in A* search, but is substantially more efficient because it only requires heuristics that are critically admissible (CA) rather than admissible---a condition that gives more effective pruning and is substantially easier to implement.}

Its usefulness has been established in a number of large-scale sequential decision settings characterized by complete state observability. However, many real decisions are made in situations where the state is not fully known to the agent making decisions. Though extensions of predictive inverse optimal control to partially observable Markov decision processes have been developed, their applicability has been limited by the complexities of inference in those representations. In this work, we extend predictive inverse optimal control to the linear- quadratic-Gaussian control setting. We establish close connections between optimal control laws for this setting and the probabilistic predictions under our approach. We demonstrate the effectiveness and benefit in estimating control policies that are influenced by partial observability on both synthetic and real datasets.}

To adhere to the uniform prior, we develop a new DP algorithm that computes the exact posteriors of all possible ancestor relations in time O(n^25^{n-1}) and space O(3^n).

These assumptions enable us to explain the complexity of the fully decoupled neural network through the prism of the results from random matrix theory. We show that for large-size decoupled networks the lowest critical values of the random loss function form a layered structure and they are located in a well-defined band lower-bounded by the global minimum. The number of local minima outside that band diminishes exponentially with the size of the network. We empirically verify that the mathematical model exhibits similar behavior as the computer simulations, despite the presence of high dependencies in real networks. We conjecture that both simulated annealing and SGD converge to the band of low critical points, and that all critical points found there are local minima of high quality measured by the test error. This emphasizes a major difference between large- and small-size networks where for the latter poor quality local minima have non-zero probability of being recovered. Finally, we prove that recovering the global minimum becomes harder as the network size increases and that it is in practice irrelevant as global minimum often leads to overfitting.}

Experiments on both large synthetic and real-world data show that our framework can effectively go back to the past, and pinpoint the source node and its initiation time  significantly more accurately than previous state-of-the-arts.}

Results of this type are important for model comparison and selection.

Extensions to the multivariate setting are far from straightforward and it is precisely the main purpose of this paper to introduce a novel and convenient (functional) criterion for measuring the performance of a scoring function regarding the anomaly ranking task, referred to as the Excess-Mass curve (EM-curve). In addition, an adaptive algorithm for building a scoring function based on unlabeled data with a nearly optimal EM is proposed and is analyzed from a statistical perspective.}

  abstract = {Online education provides data from students solving problems at different levels of proficiency over time. Unfortunately, methods that use these data for inferring student knowledge rely on costly domain expertise. We propose three novel data-driven methods that bridge sequence modeling with topic models to infer students’ time varying knowledge. These methods differ in complexity, interpretability, accuracy and human supervision. For example, our most interpretable method has similar classification accuracy to the models created by domain experts, but requires much less effort. On the other hand, the most accurate method is completely data-driven and improves predictions by up to 15% in AUC, an evaluation metric for classifiers.}

  abstract = {We address the collective matrix completion problem of jointly recovering a  collection of matrices with shared structure from partial (and potentially noisy) observations. To ensure well--posedness of the problem, we impose a joint low rank structure, wherein each component matrix is low rank and the latent space of the low rank factors corresponding to each entity is shared across the entire collection. We first develop a rigorous algebra for representing and manipulating collective--matrix structure, and identify sufficient conditions for consistent estimation of collective matrices. We then propose a tractable convex estimator for solving the collective matrix completion problem, and provide the first non--trivial theoretical guarantees  for consistency of collective matrix completion. We show that under reasonable assumptions stated in Sec. 3.1, with high probability, the proposed estimator exactly recovers the true matrices whenever sample complexity requirements dictated by Theorem 1 are met. The sample complexity requirement derived in the paper are optimum up to logarithmic factors, and significantly improve upon the requirements obtained by trivial extensions of standard matrix completion. Finally, we propose a scalable approximate algorithm to solve the proposed convex program, and  corroborate our results through simulated and real life experiments.}

Minimax filters that achieve the optimal privacy-utility trade-off from broad families of filters and loss/classifiers are defined, and algorithms for learning the filers in batch or distributed settings are presented.

We show that consistent recovery is possible up to isometric scaling when the vertex degree is at least $\omega(n^{2/(2+d)}\log(n)^{d/(d+2)})$. Our estimator is based on a careful characterization of a random walk over the directed graph and the associated continuum limit. As an algorithm, it resembles the PageRank centrality metric.

The proposed method assumes that latent vectors in different domains are generated from a common Gaussian distribution with a full covariance matrix. By inferring the mean and covariance of the common Gaussian from given cross-domain rating matrices, the latent factors are aligned, which enables us to predict ratings in different domains. Experiments conducted on rating datasets from a wide variety of domains, e.g., movie, books and electronics, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher performance for predicting cross-domain ratings than existing methods.}

Moreover, for several subclasses of interesting submodular functions that occur in applications, we show how we can provide efficient closed form expressions for the partition functions, and  thereby marginals and conditional distributions.

We explore this dependence further and consider structural constraints on the pairwise comparison matrix (a particular form of sparsity natural to this problem) that can significantly reduce the sample complexity. This motivates a new algorithm called Successive Elimination with Comparison Sparsity (SECS) that exploits sparsity to find the Borda winner using fewer samples than standard algorithms. We also evaluate the new algorithm experimentally with synthetic and real data. The results show that the sparsity model and the new algorithm can provide significant improvements over standard approaches.}

We find that widely-used, general-purpose message passing inference algorithms such as Expectation Propagation (EP) and Variational Message Passing (VMP) fail on the simplest of vision models. With these models in mind, we introduce a modification to message passing that learns to exploit their layered structure by passing 'consensus' messages that guide inference towards good solutions. Experiments on a variety of problems show that the proposed technique leads to significantly more accurate inference results, not only when compared to standard EP and VMP, but also when compared to competitive bottom-up conditional models.}

Our result shows that regularized classifications inherit robustness and provide reason on why some regularized classifications tend to be robust against data. Although most robust classification problems assume that every uncertain data lie within an identical bounded set, this paper considers a generalized model where the sizes of the bounded sets are different for each data. These models can be transformed into regularized classification models where the penalties for each data are assigned according to their losses. We see that considering such models opens up for new applications. For an example, we show that this robust classification technique can be used for Imbalanced Data Learning. We conducted experimentation with actual data and compared it with other IDL algorithms such as Cost Sensitive SVMs. This is a novel usage for the robust classification scheme and encourages it to be a suitable candidate for imbalanced data learning.}

This negatively affects the performance of the model on unseen data, and also makes the model over-sensitive to the contributions of the few, initially added tress. We show that the commonly used tool to address this issue, that of shrinkage, alleviates the problem only to a certain extent and the fundamental issue of over-specialization still remains.

In particular, these Markov chains make local changes to the trees and suffer from slow mixing when the data are high- dimensional or the best-fitting trees are more than a few layers deep. We present a novel sampler for BART based on the Particle Gibbs (PG) algorithm (Andrieu et al., 2010) and a top-down particle filtering algorithm for Bayesian decision trees (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2013).

Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the validity and high performance of our method.}

  author = {Lever, Guy and Stafford, Ronnie},
  pages = {590-598},
  abstract = {We consider modelling policies for MDPs in (vector-valued) reproducing kernel Hilbert function spaces (RKHS). This enables us to work ``non-parametrically'' in a rich function class, and provides the ability to learn complex policies. We present a framework for performing gradient-based policy optimization in the RKHS, deriving the functional gradient of the return for our policy, which has a simple form and can be estimated efficiently. The policy representation naturally focuses on the relevant region of state space defined by the policy trajectories, and does not rely on a-priori defined basis points; this can be an advantage in high dimensions where suitable basis points may be difficult to define a-priori. The method is adaptive in the sense that the policy representation will naturally adapt to the complexity of the policy being modelled, which is achieved with standard efficient sparsification tools in an RKHS. We argue that finding a good kernel on states can be easier then remetrizing a high dimensional feature space. We demonstrate the approach on benchmark domains and a simulated quadrocopter navigation task.}

  pages = {599-607},
  abstract = {When learning, such as classification, is used in adversarial settings, such as intrusion detection, intelligent adversaries will attempt to evade the resulting policies. The literature on adversarial machine learning aims to develop learning algorithms which are robust to such adversarial evasion, but exhibits two significant limitations: a) failure to account for operational constraints and b) a restriction that decisions are deterministic. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a conceptual separation between learning, used to infer attacker preferences, and operational decisions, which account for adversarial evasion, enforce operational constraints, and naturally admit randomization. Our approach gives rise to an intractably large linear program. To overcome scalability limitations, we introduce a novel method for estimating a compact parity basis representation for the operational decision function. Additionally, we develop an iterative constraint generation approach which embeds adversary's best response calculation, to arrive at a scalable algorithm for computing near-optimal randomized operational decisions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.}

We first consider the multi-armed bandit case, establish a finite-time minimax risk lower bound, and analyze the risk of three standard estimators.  It is shown that in a large class of settings the so-called regression estimator is minimax optimal up to a constant that depends on the number of actions, while the other two can be arbitrarily worse even in the limit of infinitely many data points, despite their empirical success and popularity.  The performance of these estimators are studied in synthetic and real problems; illustrating the nontriviality of this simple task.  Finally the results are extended to the problem of off-policy evaluation in contextual bandits and fixed-horizon Markov decision processes.}

In our setting, the entries of a Gaussian design matrix are randomly sparsified so that only a very small fraction of  entries are nonzero. Our proposed decoding algorithm is simple and efficient in that the major cost is one linear scan of the coordinates. Using our proposed \textbf{\em ``tie estimator''}, we are able to recover a $K$-sparse signal of length $N$ using  $1.551 eK \log K/\delta$ measurements (where $\delta\leq 0.05$ is the confidence) in one scan. The practical performance of our method, however, can be substantially better than this bound.   The Gaussian design assumption is not essential although it simplifies the analysis.   \noindent Prior studies have shown that existing one-scan (or roughly one-scan) recovery algorithms using sparse matrices would  require substantially  (e.g., one order of magnitude) more measurements than L1 decoding by linear programming, when the nonzero coordinates of signals can be either negative or positive.  In this paper, following a well-known experimental setup~\cite{Url:wiki_sparse}, we show that, at the same number of measurements, the recovery accuracies   of our proposed method are similar to   the standard L1 decoding.}

Similarity and metric learning methods learn such measures automatically from data, but they do not scale well respect to  the dimensionality of the data. In this paper, we propose a method that can learn efficiently similarity measure from high-dimensional sparse data. The core idea is to parameterize the similarity measure as a convex combination of rank-one matrices with specific sparsity structures. The parameters are then optimized with an approximate Frank-Wolfe procedure to maximally satisfy relative similarity constraints on the training data. Our algorithm greedily incorporates one pair of features at a time into the similarity measure, providing an efficient way to control the number of active features and thus reduce overfitting. It enjoys very appealing convergence guarantees and its time and memory complexity depends on the sparsity of the data instead of the dimension of the feature space.

In particular, methods based on linear programming relaxation, or dual decomposition, decompose the prediction task into multiple simpler prediction tasks and enforce agreement between overlapping predictions. In this work we observe that relaxing these agreement constraints and replacing them with soft constraints yields a much easier optimization problem.

In particular, from each point sampled from an initial proposal, AMCS collects a sequence of points by simulating two independent, but antithetic, Markov chains, each terminated by a sample-dependent stopping rule. This approach provides greater flexibility for targeting influential areas while eliminating the need to fix the length of the Markov chain a priori.

Given the complexity of a mapping between general functions it may be necessary to consider large data-sets in order to achieve a low estimation risk. To address this issue, we develop a novel scalable nonparametric estimator, the Triple-Basis Estimator (3BE), which is capable of operating over datasets with many instances. To the best of our knowledge, the 3BE is the first nonparametric FFR estimator that can scale to massive data-sets. We analyze the 3BE's risk and derive an upperbound rate.

When the underlying stochastic distribution is Gaussian, we derive an analytic solution for the long run optimal player strategy for different regimes of the bandit. In the fully adversarial limit, this solution is equivalent to the Nash equilibrium of a two-player, zero-sum semi-infinite game. We show how optimal strategies can be learned from sequential draws and reward observations in these adaptive bandits using Bayesian filtering and Thompson sampling.  Results show the qualitative difference in policy pseudo-regret between our proposed strategy and other well-known bandit algorithms.}

The main contribution of this paper is to explicitly characterize the power  of a popular nonparametric two sample test, designed for general alternatives, under a mean-shift alternative in the  high-dimensional setting. Specifically, we explicitly derive the power of the linear-time Maximum Mean Discrepancy statistic using the Gaussian kernel, where the dimension and sample size can both tend to infinity at any rate, and the two distributions differ in their means. As a corollary, we find that if the signal-to-noise ratio is held constant, then the test's power goes to one if the number of samples increases faster than the dimension increases. This is the first explicit power derivation for a general nonparametric test in the high-dimensional setting, and  the first analysis of how tests designed for general alternatives perform against easier ones.}

New experimental results comparing our method to existing state-of-the-art specialized methods on a standard range-only SLAM benchmark problem validate the strength of the approach.}

  abstract = {In structured prediction, most inference algorithms allocate a homogeneous amount of computation to all parts of the output, which can be wasteful when different parts vary widely in terms of difficulty. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous approach that dynamically allocates computation to the different parts. Given a pre-trained model, we tune its inference algorithm (a sampler) to increase test-time throughput. The inference algorithm is parametrized by a meta-model and trained via reinforcement learning, where actions correspond to sampling candidate parts of the output, and rewards are log-likelihood improvements. The meta-model is based on a set of domain-general meta-features capturing the progress of the sampler. We test our approach on five datasets and show that it attains the same accuracy as Gibbs sampling but is 2 to 5 times faster.}

  abstract = {The added flexibility of Student-t processes (TPs) over Gaussian processes (GPs) robustifies inference in outlier-contaminated noisy data. The uncertainties are better accounted for than in GP regression, because the predictive covariances explicitly depend on the training observations. For an entangled noise model, the canonical-form TP regression problem can be solved analytically, but the naive TP and GP solutions share the same cubic computational cost in the number of training observations. We show how a large class of temporal TP regression models can be reformulated as state space models, and how a forward filtering and backward smoothing recursion can be derived for solving the inference analytically in linear time complexity. This is a novel finding that generalizes the previously known connection between Gaussian process regression and Kalman filtering to more general elliptical processes and non-Gaussian Bayesian filtering. We derive this connection, demonstrate the benefits of the approach with examples, and finally apply the method to empirical data.}

Addressing learning from heterogeneous data in its full generality is a challenging problem. In this paper, we adopt instead a model in which data is observed through heterogeneous noise, where the noise level reflects the quality of the data source. We study how to use stochastic gradient algorithms to learn in this model. Our study is motivated by two concrete examples where this problem arises naturally: learning with local differential privacy based on data from multiple sources with different privacy requirements, and learning from data with labels of variable quality.  The main contribution of this paper is to identify how heterogeneous noise impacts performance. We show that given two datasets with heterogeneous noise, the order in which to use them in standard SGD depends on the learning rate. We propose a method for changing the learning rate as a function of the heterogeneity, and prove new regret bounds for our method in two cases of interest. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm on real data.}

We overcome these difficulties by developing algorithms based on fixed-point theory; our methods respect the psd constraint, while also efficiently solving the (possibly) nonconcave maximization to global optimality. Subsequently, we focus on mixture modeling using EG distributions: we present a closed-form expression of the KL-divergence between two EG distributions, which we then combine with our ML estimation methods to obtain an efficient split-and-merge expectation maximization algorithm.

Although there exist a large number of similarity measures between distributions, very little is known about their generalization performance in specific learning tasks. Learning problems formulated on distributions have an inherent two-stage sampled difficulty: in practice only samples from sampled distributions are observable, and one has to build an estimate on similarities computed between sets of points. To the best of our knowledge, the only existing method with consistency guarantees for distribution regression requires kernel density estimation as an intermediate step (which suffers from slow convergence issues in high dimensions), and the domain of the distributions to be compact Euclidean. In this paper, we provide theoretical guarantees for a remarkably simple algorithmic alternative to solve the distribution regression problem: embed the distributions to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and learn a ridge regressor from the embeddings to the outputs. Our main contribution is to prove the consistency of this technique in the two-stage sampled setting under mild conditions (on separable, topological domains endowed with kernels). As a special case, we answer a 15-year-old open question: we establish the consistency of the classical set kernel [Haussler, 1999; Gaertner et. al, 2002] in regression, and cover more recent kernels on distributions, including those due to [Christmann and Steinwart, 2010].}

Yet the preference orders by real humans become irrationally reversed, when the choice set of available options is manipulated. In order to accurately predict choice decisions involving preference reversals, which existing econometric methods have failed to incorporate, the authors introduce a new cognitive choice model whose parameters are efficiently fitted with a global convex optimization algorithm. The proposed model captures each human as a Bayesian decision maker facing a mental conflict between objective evaluation samples and a subjective prior, where the underlying objective evaluation function is rationally independent from contexts while the subjective prior is irrationally determined by each choice set. As the key idea to analytically handle the irrationality and to yield the convex optimization, the Bayesian decision mechanism is implemented as a closed-form Gaussian process regression using similarities among the available options in each context. By explaining the irrational decisions as a consequence of averting uncertainty, the proposed model outperformed the existing econometric models in predicting the irrational choice decisions recorded in real-world datasets.}

Local geometry is encoded by sparse coding and directional information of local tangent spaces and geodesics, which is important in resolving intersecting clusters and establishing the theoretical guarantees for a simplified variant of the algorithm. To avoid complication, these guarantees assume that the underlying submanifolds are geodesic.

However, it is well-established that in the high-dimensional setting (p > N) the underlying projection estimator degenerates. Moreover, any linear discriminate function involving a large number of features may be difficult to interpret. To ameliorate these issues, two general categories of sparse LDA modifications have been proposed, both to reduce the number of active features and to stabilize the resulting projections. The first, based on optimal scoring, is more straightforward to implement and analyze but has been heavily criticized for its ambiguous connection with the original LDA formulation. In contrast, a second strategy applies sparse penalty functions directly to the original LDA objective but requires additional heuristic trade-off parameters, has unknown global and local minima properties, and requires a greedy sequential optimization procedure. In all cases the choice of sparse regularizer can be important, but no rigorous guidelines have been provided regarding which penalty might be preferable. Against this backdrop, we winnow down the broad space of candidate sparse LDA algorithms and promote a specific selection based on optimal scoring coupled with a particular, complementary sparse regularizer. This overall process ultimately progresses our understanding of sparse LDA in general, while leading to targeted modifications of existing algorithms that produce superior results in practice on three high-dimensional gene data sets.}

In some cases, the true clusters exhibit a known size distribution; in image segmentation, for instance, human- segmented images tend to yield segment sizes that follow a power-law distribution. In this paper, we propose a general framework of power-law graph cut algorithms that produce clusters whose sizes are power-law distributed, and also does not fix the number of clusters upfront. To achieve our goals, we treat the Pitman-Yor exchangeable partition probability function (EPPF) as a regularizer to graph cut objectives. Because the result- ing objectives cannot be solved by relaxing via eigenvectors, we derive a simple iterative algorithm to locally optimize the objectives.
