  title = 	 {Grammar Compression: Grammatical Inference by Compression and Its Application to Real Data
},
pages = 	 {3-20},
  abstract = 	 {A grammatical inference algorithm tries to find as a small grammar as possible representing 
a potentially infinite sequence of strings.
Here, let us consider a simple restriction: the input is a finite sequence or it might be a singleton set.
Then the restricted problem is called the {\em grammar compression} to find the smallest CFG generating just the input.
In the last decade many researchers have tackled this problem because of its scalable applications, e.g.,
expansion of data storage capacity, speeding-up information retrieval, DNA sequencing, frequent pattern mining, 
and similarity search.
We would review the history of grammar compression and its wide applications together with an important future work.
The study of grammar compression has begun with the bad news: the smallest CFG problem is NP-hard.
Hence, the first question is: Can we get a near-optimal solution in a polynomial time? 
(Is there a reasonable approximation algorithm?)
And the next question is: Can we minimize the costs of time and space?
(Does a linear time algorithm exist within an optimal working space?)
The recent results produced by the research community answer affirmatively the questions.
We introduce several important results and typical applications to a huge text collection.
On the other hand, the shrinkage of the advantage of grammar compression is caused by the data explosion,
since there is no working space for storing the whole data supplied from data stream.
The last question is: How can we handle the stream data?
For this question, we propose the framework of {\em stream grammar compression}
for the next generation and its attractive application to fast data transmission.},

  title = 	 {Towards a rationalist theory of language acquisition},
  pages =  {21-32},
  abstract = 	 {Recent computational, mathematical work on learnability extends to
classes of languages that plausibly include the human languages, but
there is nevertheless a gulf between this work and linguistic
theory. The languages of the two fields seem almost completely
disjoint and incommensurable. This paper shows that this has
happened, at least in part, because the recent advances in
learnability have been misdescribed in two important respects. First,
they have been described as resting on `empiricist' conceptions of
language, when actually, in fundamental respects that are made precise
here, they are equally compatible with the `rationalist', `nativist'
traditions in linguistic theory. Second, the recent mathematical
proposals have sometimes been presented as if they not only advance
but complete the account of human language acquisition, taking the
rather dramatic difference between what current mathematical models
can achieve and what current linguistic theories tell us as an
indication that current linguistic theories are quite generally
mistaken. This paper compares the two perspectives and takes some
first steps toward a unified theory, aiming to identify some common ground
where `rationalist' linguistic hypotheses 
could directly address weaknesses in the current mathematical proposals.},

pages = 	 {49-63},
  abstract = 	 {Based on Harris's substitutability criterion, the recent definitions of classes of substitutable languages have led to interesting polynomial learnability results for expressive formal languages. These classes are also promising for practical applications: in natural language analysis, because definitions have strong linguisitic support, but also in biology for modeling protein families, as suggested in our previous study introducing the class of local substitutable languages. But turning recent theoretical advances into practice badly needs truly practical algorithms.
We present here an efficient learning algorithm, motivated by intelligibility and parsing efficiency of the result, which directly reduces the positive sample into a small non-redundant canonical grammar of the target substitutable language. 
Thanks to this new algorithm, we have been able to extend our experimentation to a complete protein dataset confirming that it is possible to learn grammars on proteins with high specificity and good sensitivity by a generalization based on local substitutability.},

spectral learning algorithm can be taken as an initial

likelihood of the observation data. Secondly, we show how the
inference problem can naturally be expressed in the framework of
Structured Low-Rank Approximation. Both ideas are tested on a
benchmark extracted from the PAutomaC challenge.},

pages = 	 {79-93},
  abstract = 	 {Counterexample analysis has emerged as one of the key challenges in Angluin-style
active automata learning.  Rivest and Schapire (1993) showed for the $\mathrm{L}^*$ algorithm that
a single suffix of the counterexample was sufficient to ensure progress. 
This suffix can be obtained in a binary search fashion, requiring $\Theta(\log m)$ membership queries
for a counterexample of length $m$. Correctly implementing this algorithm can be quite tricky,
and its correctness sometimes even has been disputed. In this paper, we establish an abstract
framework for counterexample analysis, which basically reduces the problem of finding a suffix
to finding distinct neighboring elements in a $0/1$ sequence, where the first element is $0$
and the last element is $1$. We demonstrate the conciseness and simplicity of our framework
by using it to present new counterexample analysis algorithms, which, while maintaining
the worst-case complexity of $O(\log m)$, perform significantly better in practice. Furthermore,
we contribute---in a second instantiation of our framework, highlighting its generality---the
first sublinear counterexample analysis procedures for the algorithm due to
Kearns and Vazirani (1994).},

  abstract = 	 {In this paper, we present a new algorithm that can identify in polynomial time and data using positive examples any class of subsequential functions that share a particular finite-state structure. While this structure is given to the learner \textit{a priori}, it allows for the exact learning of partial functions, and both the time and data complexity of the algorithm are linear.  
We demonstrate the algorithm on examples from natural language phonology and morphology in which the needed structure has been argued to be plausibly known in advance. A procedure for making any subsequential transducer onward without changing its structure is also presented.},

  abstract = 	 {This paper investigates the use of linear representations of trees (i.e. mappings from the set of trees into a finite dimensional vector space which are induced by rational series on trees) in the context of structured data learning. We argue that this representation space can be more appealing than the space of trees to handle machine learning problems involving trees. Focusing on a tree series maximization problem, we first analyze its complexity to motivate the use of approximation techniques. We then show how a tree series can be extended to the continuous representation space, we propose an adaptive Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to solve the maximization problem in this space, and we establish convergence guarantees. Finally, we provide some experiments comparing our algorithm with an implementation of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in the space of trees.},

However, these results are still not extended to probabilistic grammars. In this work, we give a practical algorithm, with some proven properties, that learns a subclass of probabilistic grammars from positive data. A minimum satisfiability solver is used to direct the search towards small grammars. Experiments on typical context-free languages and artificial natural language grammars give positive results.},

  title = 	 {Inferring (k,l)-context-sensitive probabilistic context-free grammars using hierarchical Pitman-Yor processes},
pages = 	 {153-166},
  abstract = 	 {Motivated by the idea of applying nonparametric Bayesian models to dual approaches for distributional learning,
we define $(k,l)$-context-sensitive probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) using hierarchical Pitman-Yor processes (PYPs).
The data sparseness problem that occurs when inferring context-sensitive probabilities for rules
is handled by the smoothing effect of hierarchical PYPs.
Many possible definitions or constructions of PYP hierarchies can be used to represent
the context sensitivity of derivations of CFGs in Chomsky normal form.
In this study, we use a definition that is considered to be the most natural as an extension of infinite PCFGs defined in previous studies.
A Markov Chain Monte Carlo method called blocked Metropolis-Hastings (MH) sampling is known to be effective for inferring PCFGs from unsupervised sentences.
Blocked MH sampling is applicable to $(k,l)$-context-sensitive PCFGs by modifying their so-called inside probabilities.
We show that the computational cost of blocked MH sampling for $(k,l)$-context-sensitive PCFGs is $O(|V|^{l+3}|s|^3)$
for each sentence $s$, where $V$ is a set of nonterminals.
This cost is too high to iterate sufficient sampling times, especially when $l \neq 0$,
thus we propose an alternative sampling method
that separates the sampling procedure into pointwise sampling for nonterminals and
blocked sampling for rules.
The computational cost of this sampling method is $O(\min\{|s|^{l},|V|^{l}\} (|V||s|^2+|s|^3) )$.

pages = 	 {167-181},
  abstract = 	 {In Angluin's $L^{\ast}$ algorithm a learner constructs a sequence of hypotheses
in order to learn a regular language. Each hypothesis is consistent with a
larger set of observations and is described by a bigger model. From a
behavioral perspective, however, a hypothesis is not always better than the
previous one, in the sense that the minimal length of a counterexample that
distinguishes a hypothesis from the target language may decrease.  We present a
simple modification of the $L^{\ast}$ algorithm that ensures that for
subsequent hypotheses the minimal length of a counterexample never
decreases, which implies that the distance to the target language never
increases in a corresponding ultrametric.  Preliminary experimental evidence
suggests that our algorithm speeds up learning in practical applications by
reducing the number of equivalence queries.},

pages = 	 {193-206},
  abstract = 	 {Grammatical inference deals with learning of grammars describing
  languages.  Formal grammatical inference aims at identifying
  families of languages that have a shared property, which can be used
  to prove efficient learnability of the families formally.  In
  contrast, in empirical grammatical inference research, practical
  systems are developed that are applied to languages.  The
  effectiveness of these systems is measured by comparing the learned
  grammar against a Gold standard which indicates the ground truth.
  From successful empirical learnability results, either shared properties
  may be identified, leading to further formal learnability results,
  or modifications to the systems may be made, improving practical
  results.  Proper evaluation of empirical systems is, therefore,
  essential.  Here, we evaluate and compare existing state-of-the-art
  context-free grammar learning systems (and novel systems based on
  combinations of existing phases) in a standardized evaluation
  environment (on a corpus of plain natural language sentences),
