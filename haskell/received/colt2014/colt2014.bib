	abstract = {
We study several questions in the \emph{reliable agnostic} learning framework
of Kalai et al. (2009), which captures learning tasks in which one type of
error is costlier than other types. A positive reliable classifier is one that
makes no false positive errors.  The goal in the \emph{positive reliable}
agnostic framework is to output a hypothesis with the following properties: (i)
its false positive error rate is at most $\epsilon$, (ii) its false negative
error rate is at most $\epsilon$ more than that of the best positive reliable
classifier from the class.  A closely related notion is \emph{fully reliable}
agnostic learning, which considers \emph{partial classifiers} that are allowed
to predict ``unknown'' on some inputs. The best fully reliable partial
classifier is one that makes no errors and minimizes the probability of
predicting ``unknown'', and the goal in fully reliable learning is to output a
hypothesis that is almost as good as the best fully reliable partial classifier
from a class.

For distribution-independent learning,  the best known algorithms for PAC
learning typically utilize polynomial threshold representations, while the state
of the art agnostic learning algorithms use point-wise polynomial
approximations.  We show that \emph{one-sided polynomial approximations}, an
intermediate notion between polynomial threshold representations and point-wise
polynomial approximations, suffice for learning in the reliable agnostic
settings. We then show that majorities can be fully reliably learned and
disjunctions of majorities can be positive reliably learned, through
constructions of appropriate one-sided polynomial approximations.  Our fully
reliable algorithm for majorities provides the first evidence that fully
reliable learning may be strictly easier than agnostic learning.  Our algorithms
also satisfy strong attribute-efficiency properties, and in many cases they
provide smooth tradeoffs between sample complexity and running time.

   abstract = {In this paper, we consider networks consisting of a finite number of non-overlapping communities. To extract these communities, the interaction between pairs of nodes may be sampled from a large available data set, which allows a given node pair to be sampled several times. When a node pair is sampled, the observed outcome is a binary random variable, equal to 1 if nodes interact and to 0 otherwise. The outcome is more likely to be positive if nodes belong to the same communities. For a given budget of node pair samples or observations, we wish to jointly design a sampling strategy (the sequence of sampled node pairs) and a clustering algorithm that recover the hidden communities with the highest possible accuracy. We consider both non-adaptive and adaptive sampling strategies, and for both classes of strategies, we derive fundamental performance limits satisfied by any sampling and clustering algorithm. In particular, we provide necessary conditions for the existence of algorithms recovering the communities accurately as the network size grows large. We also devise simple algorithms that accurately reconstruct the communities when this is at all possible, hence proving that the proposed necessary conditions for accurate community detection are also sufficient. The classical problem of community detection in the stochastic block model can be seen as a particular instance of the problems consider here. But our framework covers more general scenarios where the sequence of sampled node pairs can be designed in an adaptive manner. The paper provides new results for the stochastic block model, and extends the analysis to the case of adaptive sampling.}

We show under general conditions that for any normed SC, $\sigma(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')=\|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'\|$, regret \textit{cannot be bounded} given only a bound $Q$ on the quadratic variation of losses. With an additional bound $\Lambda$ on the total length of losses, we prove $O(\sqrt{Q+\Lambda})$ regret for Regularized Follow the Leader (RFTL). Furthermore, an $O(\sqrt{Q})$ bound holds for RFTL given a cost $\|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'\|^2$. By generalizing the Shrinking Dartboard algorithm, we also show an expected regret bound for the best expert setting with any SC, given bounds on the total loss of the best expert and the quadratic variation of any expert. As SCs vanish, all our bounds depend purely on quadratic variation.

We apply our results to pricing options in an arbitrage-free market with proportional transaction costs. In particular, we upper bound the price of ``at the money'' call options, assuming bounds on the quadratic variation of a stock price and the minimum of summed gains and summed losses.}

  title     = {The Complexity of Learning Halfspaces using Generalized Linear Methods},
  pages     = {244-286},
  abstract  = {Many popular learning algorithms (E.g. Regression, Fourier-Transform based algorithms, Kernel SVM and Kernel ridge regression) operate by reducing the problem to a convex optimization problem over a set of functions. These methods offer the currently best approach to several central problems such as learning half spaces and learning DNF's. In addition they are widely used in numerous application domains. Despite their importance, there are still very few proof techniques to show limits on the power of these algorithms.

We study the performance of this approach in the problem of
(agnostically and improperly) learning halfspaces with margin
$\gamma$. Let $D$ be a distribution over labeled examples. The
$\gamma$-margin error of a hyperplane $h$ is the probability of an
example to fall on the wrong side of $h$ or at a distance $\le\gamma$
from it. The $\gamma$-margin error of the best $h$ is denoted
$\mathrm{Err}_\gamma(D)$.  An $\alpha(\gamma)$-approximation algorithm
receives $\gamma,\epsilon$ as input and, using i.i.d. samples of $D$,
outputs a classifier with error rate $\le
\alpha(\gamma)\mathrm{Err}_\gamma(D) + \epsilon$.  Such an algorithm is
efficient if it uses $\mathrm{poly}(\frac{1}{\gamma},\frac{1}{\epsilon})$
samples and runs in time polynomial in the sample size.

The best approximation ratio achievable by an efficient algorithm is
$O\left(\frac{1/\gamma}{\sqrt{\log(1/\gamma)}}\right)$ and is achieved
using an algorithm from the above class. Our main result shows that the
approximation ratio of every efficient algorithm from this family must be $\ge
\Omega\left(\frac{1/\gamma}{\mathrm{poly}\left(\log\left(1/\gamma\right)\right)}\right)$,
essentially matching the best known upper bound.}

  \emph{improper}, namely, it must have the ability to output
  hypotheses which do not belong to the hypothesis class, even though
  it knows that all the labels are generated by some hypothesis from

  back the fundamental question of ``how to learn''? We give a

  we turn to study the popular hypothesis class of generalized linear
  classifiers. We derive optimal learners that, unlike the one-inclusion algorithm, are

  pages     = {317-338},
  abstract={The Thompson Sampling (TS) policy  is a widely implemented algorithm for the stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem.
  Given a prior distribution over possible parameter settings of the underlying reward distributions of the arms, at each time instant,
  the policy plays an arm with probability equal to the probability that this arm has largest mean reward conditioned on the current posterior
  distributions of the arms.  This policy generalizes the celebrated ``probability matching'' heuristic which has been experimentally and widely
  observed in human decision making. However, despite its ubiquity, the Thompson Sampling policy is poorly understood.

  Our goal in this paper is to make progress towards understanding the empirical success of this policy. We proceed using the lens of
  approximation algorithms and problem definitions from stochastic optimization. We focus on an objective function termed {\em stochastic
  regret} that captures the expected number of times the policy plays an arm that is not the eventual best arm, where the expectation is
  over the prior distribution. Given such a definition, we show that TS is a $2$--approximation to the optimal decision policy in two
  extreme but canonical scenarios. One such scenario is the two-armed bandit problem which is used as a calibration point in all bandit
  literature. The second scenario is stochastic optimization where the outcome of a random variable is revealed in a single play to a high
  or low deterministic value. We show that the $2$ approximation is tight in both these scenarios. We provide an uniform analysis framework
  that in theory is capable of proving our  conjecture that the TS policy is a $2$--approximation to the optimal decision policy for
  minimizing stochastic regret, for any prior distribution and any time horizon.}

Moreover, as opposed to previous works on approachability, and in the spirit of online learning, we do not assume that there is a known game structure with actions for two players. Rather, the player receives an arbitrary vector-valued reward vector at every round. We show that it is impossible, in general, to approach the best target set in hindsight. We further propose a concrete strategy that approaches a non-trivial relaxation of the best-in-hindsight given the actual rewards. Our approach does not require projection onto a target set and amounts to switching between scalar regret minimization algorithms that are performed in episodes.}

Our algorithm employs an optimal adaptive strategy---a strategy that performs the best possible action at each step after observing the outcomes of all previous coin tosses. Consequently, our algorithm is also optimal for any given starting history of outcomes.

 over the full set of features, the true labeling is (almost) fully determined.

 However, agnostic learning of deterministic labels has so far received little research attention.
We investigate this setting and show that it
displays a behavior that is quite different from that of
the fundamental results of the common (PAC) learning setups.
First, we show that the sample complexity of learning a binary hypothesis class (with respect to deterministic labeling functions) is not fully determined by the VC-dimension of the class.
For any $d$, we present classes of VC-dimension $d$ that are learnable from ${\tilde O}(d/\epsilon)$-many samples and classes that require samples of size $\Omega(d/\epsilon^2)$.
Furthermore, we show that in this setup, there are classes for which any proper learner has suboptimal sample complexity.  While the class can be learned with sample complexity ${\tilde O}(d/\epsilon)$, any \emph{proper} (and therefore, any ERM) algorithm requires $\Omega(d/\epsilon^2)$ samples.
We provide combinatorial characterizations of both phenomena, and further analyze
the utility of unlabeled samples in this setting.
Lastly, we discuss the error rates of nearest neighbor algorithms under deterministic labels and additional niceness-of-data assumptions.}

  abstract  = {We study the problem of approximating and learning coverage functions. A function $c: 2^{[n]} \rightarrow \mathbf{R}^{+}$
  is a coverage function, if there exists a universe $U$ with non-negative weights $w(u)$ for each $u \in U$ and subsets
  $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$ of $U$ such that $c(S) = \sum_{u \in \cup_{i \in S} A_i} w(u)$.
  Alternatively, coverage functions can be described as non-negative linear combinations of monotone disjunctions.
  They are a natural subclass of submodular functions and arise in a number of applications.

    We give an algorithm that for any $\gamma,\delta>0$, given random and uniform examples of an unknown coverage function $c$,
    finds a function $h$ that approximates $c$ within factor $1+\gamma$ on all but $\delta$-fraction of the points in time
    $poly(n,1/\gamma,1/\delta)$. This is the first fully-polynomial algorithm for learning an interesting class of functions in the
    demanding PMAC model of Balcan and Harvey (2011). Our algorithms are based on several new structural properties of coverage functions.
    Using the results in (Feldman and Kothari, 2014), we also show that coverage functions are learnable agnostically with excess $\ell_1$-error
    $\epsilon$ over all product and symmetric distributions in time $n^{\log(1/\epsilon)}$.
    In contrast, we show that, without assumptions on the distribution, learning coverage functions is at least as
    hard as learning polynomial-size disjoint DNF formulas, a class of functions for which the best known algorithm runs
    in time $2^{\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})}$ (Klivans and Servedio, 2004).

    As an application of our learning results, we give simple differentially-private algorithms for releasing monotone conjunction
    counting queries with low {\em average} error. In particular, for any $k \leq n$, we obtain private release of $k$-way marginals with average error
    $\bar{\alpha}$ in time $n^{O(\log(1/\bar{\alpha}))}$. }

 abstract = {Matrix Completion is the problem of recovering an unknown real-valued low-rank matrix from a subsample of its entries. Important recent results show that the problem can be solved efficiently under the assumption that the unknown matrix is incoherent and the subsample is drawn uniformly at random. Are these assumptions necessary?

It is well known that Matrix Completion in its full generality is NP-hard. However, little is known if we make additional assumptions such as incoherence and permit the algorithm to output a matrix of slightly higher rank. In this paper we prove that Matrix Completion remains computationally intractable even if the unknown matrix has rank~$4$ but we are allowed to output any constant rank matrix, and even if additionally we assume that the unknown  matrix is incoherent and are shown $90\%$ of the entries. This result relies on the conjectured hardness of the $4$-Coloring problem. We also consider the positive semidefinite Matrix Completion problem. Here we show a similar hardness result under the standard assumption that $\mathrm{P}\ne \mathrm{NP}.$

Our results greatly narrow the gap between existing feasibility results and computational lower bounds. In particular, we believe that our results give the first complexity-theoretic justification for why distributional assumptions are
needed beyond the incoherence assumption in order to obtain positive results. On the technical side, we contribute several new ideas on how to encode hard combinatorial problems in low-rank optimization problems. We hope that these techniques will be helpful in further understanding the computational limits of Matrix Completion and related problems.}

Kruskal's theorem has found many applications in proving the identifiability of parameters for various latent variable models and mixture models such as Hidden Markov models, topic models etc. Our robust version immediately implies identifiability using only polynomially many samples in many of these settings -- an essential
first step towards efficient learning algorithms.

Our methods also apply to the ``overcomplete'' case, which has proved challenging in many applications. Given the importance of Kruskal's theorem in the tensor literature, we expect that our robust version will have several applications beyond the settings we explore in this work.

This is a central notion in signal processing, statistics and machine learning. But in applications such as {\em sparse coding}, edge detection, compression and super resolution, the dictionary $A$ is unknown and has to be learned from random examples of the form $Y = AX$ where $X$ is drawn from an appropriate distribution --- this is the {\em dictionary learning} problem. In most settings, $A$ is {\em overcomplete}: it has more columns than rows. This paper presents a polynomial-time algorithm for learning overcomplete dictionaries; the only previously known algorithm with provable guarantees is the recent work of Spielman et al. (2012) who who gave an algorithm for the undercomplete case, which is rarely the case in applications. Our algorithm applies to {\em incoherent} dictionaries which have been a central object of study since they were introduced in seminal work of Donoho and Huo (1999). In particular, a dictionary is $\mu$-incoherent if each pair of columns has inner product at most $\mu / \sqrt{n}$.

The algorithm makes natural stochastic assumptions about the unknown sparse vector $X$, which can contain $k \leq c \min(\sqrt{n}/\mu \log n, m^{1/2 - \eta})$ non-zero entries (for any $\eta > 0$). This is close to the best $k$ allowable by the best sparse recovery algorithms  {\em even if one knows the dictionary $A$ exactly}. Moreover, both the running time and sample complexity depend on $\log 1/\epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is the target accuracy, and so our algorithms converge very quickly to the true dictionary. Our algorithm can also tolerate substantial amounts of noise provided it is incoherent with respect to the dictionary (e.g., Gaussian). In the noisy setting, our running time and sample complexity depend polynomially on $1/\epsilon$, and this is necessary. }

This problem is motivated by several practical applications such as  crowdsourcing, recommendation systems, and learning Boolean functions.
The existing solutions either heavily rely on the fact that the number of mixtures is finite or have  sample/time complexity that is exponential in the number of mixtures.
In this paper, we introduce a polynomial time/sample complexity  method for learning a mixture of $r$ discrete product distributions over $\{1, 2, \dots, \ell\}^n$, for  general $\ell$ and $r$.
We show that our approach is consistent and further provide finite sample guarantees.

We use recently developed techniques from tensor decompositions for moment matching.
A crucial step  in these approaches is to construct certain  tensors  with low-rank spectral decompositions.
These tensors are typically estimated from the sample moments.
The main challenge in learning mixtures of discrete product distributions is that  the corresponding low-rank tensors cannot be obtained directly from the sample moments.
Instead, we need to estimate a low-rank matrix using only off-diagonal entries, and estimate a tensor using a few linear measurements.
We give an alternating minimization based method to estimate the low-rank matrix, and  formulate the tensor estimation problem as a least-squares problem.

In this paper, we consider the question of statistical consistency of such methods. We focus on settings where the binary problems are solved by minimizing a binary surrogate loss, and derive general conditions on the binary surrogate loss under which the one-vs-all and all-pairs code matrices yield consistent algorithms with respect to the multiclass 0-1 loss. We then consider general multiclass learning problems defined by a general multiclass loss, and derive conditions on the output code matrix and binary surrogates under which the resulting algorithm is consistent with respect to the target multiclass loss. We also consider \emph{probabilistic} code matrices, where one reduces a
multiclass problem to a set of \emph{class probability labeled} binary problems, and show that these can yield benefits in the sense of requiring a smaller number of binary problems to achieve overall consistency. Our analysis makes interesting connections with the theory of proper composite losses (Buja et al., 2005; Reid and Williamson, 2010); these play a role in constructing the right `decoding' for converting the predictions on the binary problems to the final multiclass prediction. To our knowledge, this is the first work that comprehensively studies consistency properties of output code based methods for multiclass learning.}

To more accurately model real systems we consider a class of networks (i) whose edges may carry labels and (ii) which may lack a clustered structure.

Our goal is then to infer the edge label distributions from a partially observed network.
We propose a computationally efficient spectral algorithm and show it allows for asymptotically correct inference when the average node degree could be as low as logarithmic in the total number of nodes. Conversely, if the average node degree is below a specific constant threshold, we show that no algorithm can achieve better inference than guessing without using the observations. As a byproduct of our analysis, we show that our model provides a general procedure to construct random graph models with a spectrum asymptotic to a pre-specified eigenvalue distribution such as a power-law distribution.

  abstract  = {We consider online prediction with expert advice. Over the course of many trials, the goal of the learning algorithm is to achieve small additional loss (i.e.\ regret) compared to the loss of the best from a set of $K$ experts. The two most popular algorithms are Hedge/Weighted Majority and Follow the Perturbed Leader (FPL). The latter algorithm first perturbs the loss of each expert
by independent additive noise drawn from a fixed distribution, and then predicts with the expert of minimum perturbed loss (``the leader'') where ties are broken uniformly at random. To achieve the optimal worst-case regret as a function of the loss $L^*$ of the best expert in hindsight, the two types of algorithms need to tune their learning rate or noise magnitude, respectively, as a function of $L^*$.

Instead of perturbing the losses of the experts with additive noise, we randomly set them to $0$ or $1$ before selecting the leader. We show that our perturbations are an instance of dropout --- because experts may be interpreted as features --- although for non-binary losses the dropout probability needs to be made dependent on the losses to get good regret bounds. We show that this simple, tuning-free version of the FPL algorithm achieves two feats: optimal worst-case $O(\sqrt{L^* \ln K} + \ln K)$ regret as a function of $L^*$, and optimal $O(\ln K)$ regret when the loss vectors are drawn i.i.d.\ from a fixed distribution and there is a gap between the expected loss of the best expert and all others.

A number of recent algorithms from the Hedge family (AdaHedge and FlipFlop) also achieve this, but they employ sophisticated tuning regimes. The dropout perturbation of the losses of the experts result in different noise distributions for each expert (because they depend on the expert's total loss) and
curiously enough no additional tuning is needed: the choice of dropout probability only affects the constants.}

The regret analysis of our algorithms relies on a new concentration inequality for weighted sums of KL divergences between the empirical distributions of rewards and their true distributions.

This approach is shown, through numerical experiments, to significantly outperform existing algorithms that directly deal with the continuous set of arms.

    Differential privacy is a strong and well-studied notion of privacy introduced by Dwork et al. (2006)
    that ensures that the output of an algorithm leaks little information about the data point provided
    by any of the participating individuals.
    Sample complexity of private PAC and agnostic learning was studied in a number of prior works starting with
    (Kasiviswanathan et al., 2008) but a number of basic questions still remain open
    (Beimel et al. 2010; Chaudhuri and Hsu, 2011; Beimel et al., 2013a,b).

    Our main contribution is an equivalence between the sample complexity of differentially-private learning of a concept class $C$
    (or $\mathrm{SCDP}(C)$) and the randomized one-way communication complexity of the evaluation problem for concepts from $C$.
    Using this equivalence we prove the following bounds:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathrm{SCDP}(C) = \Omega(\mathrm{LDim}(C))$, where $\mathrm{LDim}(C)$ is the Littlestone's (1987) dimension characterizing
        the number of mistakes in the online-mistake-bound learning model.
        This result implies that $\mathrm{SCDP}(C)$ is different from the VC-dimension of $C$, resolving
        one of the main open questions from prior work.
    \item For any $t$, there exists a class $C$ such that $\mathrm{LDim}(C)=2$ but $\mathrm{SCDP}(C) \geq t$.
    \item For any $t$, there exists a class $C$ such that the sample complexity of (pure) $\alpha$-differentially
    private PAC learning is $\Omega(t/\alpha)$ but the sample complexity of the relaxed $(\alpha,\beta)$-differentially
    private PAC learning is $O(\log(1/\beta)/\alpha)$. This resolves an open problem from (Beimel et al., 2013b).
    \end{itemize}

    by Beimel et al., (2013a) and our bounds rely on a number of known results from communication complexity.}

abstract = {
In this paper we show that very large mixtures of Gaussians are efficiently learnable in high dimension.
More precisely, we prove that a mixture with known identical covariance matrices whose number of components is a polynomial of any fixed degree in the dimension $n$ is polynomially learnable as long as a certain non-degeneracy condition on the means is satisfied. It turns out that this condition is generic in the sense of smoothed complexity, as soon as the dimensionality of the space is high enough.
Moreover, we prove that no such condition can possibly exist in low dimension and the problem of learning the parameters is generically hard.  In contrast, much of the existing work on Gaussian Mixtures relies on low-dimensional projections and thus hits an artificial barrier.

Our main result on mixture recovery relies on a new ``Poissonization"-based technique, which transforms a mixture of Gaussians to a linear map of a product distribution. The problem of learning this map can be efficiently solved using some recent results on tensor decompositions and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), thus giving an  algorithm for recovering the mixture.
In addition, we combine our low-dimensional hardness results for Gaussian mixtures with  Poissonization to show how to embed difficult instances of low-dimensional Gaussian mixtures into the ICA setting, thus establishing exponential information-theoretic lower bounds for underdetermined ICA in low dimension. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such result  in the literature.

In addition to contributing to  the problem of Gaussian mixture learning, we
 believe that this work is among the first steps toward better understanding the rare phenomenon of the ``blessing of dimensionality" in the computational aspects of statistical inference.

  Herding is an algorithm of recent interest in the machine learning community,

It solves the following sampling problem:

construct an infinite sequence of points from $\mathcal{X}$ such that,
for every $t \geq 1$, the mean of the first $t$ points in that sequence
lies within Euclidean distance $O(1/t)$ of $\mu$.
The classic Perceptron boundedness theorem implies that such a result
actually holds for a wide class of algorithms,
although the factors suppressed by the $O(1/t)$
notation are exponential in $d$.
Thus, to establish a non-trivial result for the sampling problem,
one must carefully analyze the factors suppressed by the $O(1/t)$ error bound.

This paper studies the best error that can be achieved for the sampling problem.
Known analysis of the Herding algorithm give an error bound that depends on geometric
properties of $\mathcal{X}$ but, even under favorable conditions, this bound depends linearly on $d$.
We present a new polynomial-time algorithm that solves the sampling problem
with error $O\left(\sqrt{d} \log^{2.5}|\mathcal{X}| / t \right)$ assuming that $\mathcal{X}$ is finite.
Our algorithm is based on recent algorithmic results in \textit{discrepancy theory}.
We also show that any algorithm for the sampling problem must have error $\Omega( \sqrt{d} / t )$. This implies that our algorithm is optimal to within logarithmic factors.

Namely, given a collection of $N$ hypotheses containing at least one candidate that is $\varepsilon$-close to an unknown distribution, our algorithm outputs a candidate which is $O(\varepsilon)$-close to the  distribution.
The algorithm requires ${O}(\log{N}/\varepsilon^2)$ samples from the unknown distribution and ${O}(N \log N/\varepsilon^2)$ time, which improves previous such results (such as the Scheff\'e estimator) from a quadratic dependence of the running time on $N$ to quasilinear. Given the wide use of such results for the purpose of hypothesis selection, our improved algorithm implies immediate improvements to any such use.

	abstract = {We study a new class of online learning problems where each of the online algorithm's actions is assigned an adversarial value, and the loss of the algorithm at each step is a known and deterministic function of the values assigned to its recent actions. This class includes problems where the algorithm's loss is the \emph{minimum} over the recent adversarial values, the \emph{maximum} over the recent values, or a \emph{linear combination} of the recent values. We analyze the minimax regret of this class of problems when the algorithm receives bandit feedback, and prove that when the    \emph{minimum} or \emph{maximum} functions are used, the minimax regret is $\widetilde \Omega(T^{2/3})$ (so called \emph{hard} online learning problems), and when a linear function is used, the minimax regret is $\widetilde O(\sqrt{T})$ (so called \emph{easy} learning problems). Previously, the only online learning problem that was known to be provably hard was the multi-armed bandit with switching costs.}

  pages     = {1232-1264},
 abstract  = {We establish optimal rates for online regression for arbitrary classes of regression functions in terms of the sequential entropy introduced in (Rakhlin et al., 2010). The optimal rates are shown to exhibit a phase transition analogous to the i.i.d./statistical learning case, studied in  (Rakhlin et al., 2014b). In the frequently encountered situation when sequential entropy and i.i.d. empirical entropy match, our results point to the interesting phenomenon that the rates for statistical learning with squared loss and online nonparametric regression are the same.

	In addition to a non-algorithmic study of minimax regret, we exhibit a generic forecaster that enjoys the established optimal rates. We also provide a recipe for designing online regression algorithms that can be computationally efficient. We illustrate the techniques by deriving existing and new forecasters for the case of finite experts and for online linear regression.}

Several results establish tightness of SDP based relaxations in the regime where exact recovery from MLE is possible. However, to the best of our knowledge, their tightness is not understood beyond this regime.
As an illustrative example, we focus on the generalized Procrustes problem.}

                  \textsc{AdaBoost.MH} is one of the best multi-class boosting
                  algorithms when the classical one-against-all base
                  classifiers, proposed in the seminal paper of Schapire and
                  Singer~(1999), are replaced by factorized base classifiers
                  containing a binary classifier and a vote (or code) vector. In
                  a slightly different setup, a similar factorization coupled
                  with an iterative optimization of the two factors also proved
                  to be an excellent approach (Gao and Koller, 2011). The main
                  algorithmic advantage of our approach over the original setup
                  of Schapire and Singer~(1999) is that trees can be built in a
                  straightforward way by using the binary classifier at inner
                  nodes. In this open problem paper we take a step back to the
                  basic setup of boosting generic multi-class factorized
                  (Hamming) classifiers (so no trees), and state the classical
                  problem of boosting-like convergence of the training
                  error. Given a vote vector, training the classifier leads to a
                  standard weighted binary classification problem. The main
                  difficulty of proving the convergence is that, unlike in
                  binary \textsc{AdaBoost}, the sum of the weights in this
                  weighted binary classification problem is less than one, which
                  means that the lower bound on the edge, coming from the weak
                  learning condition, shrinks. To show the convergence, we need
                  a (uniform) lower bound on the sum of the weights in this
                  derived binary classification problem.}

it is possible to recover the correct network structure with high probability if we observe
$O(d^3 \log N)$ cascades, where d is the maximum number of parents of a node and N is the total
number of nodes. However, the incoherence condition depends, in a non-trivial way, on the
source (node) distribution of the cascades, which is typically unknown. Our open problem is
whether it is possible to design an active algorithm which samples the source locations in a
sequential manner and achieves the same or even better sample complexity, e.g., $o(d_i^3 \log N)$,

    In this problem the learner is given random examples labeled by an unknown halfspace function $f$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Further $f$ is $r$-sparse,
    that is it depends on at most $r$ out of $n$ variables. An attribute-efficient learning algorithm is an algorithm that can output a hypothesis
    close to $f$ using a polynomial in $r$ and $\log n$ number of examples (Blum, 1992). Despite a number of attempts and some partial
    progress, there are no efficient
    algorithms or hardness results for the problem. We propose a potentially easier question: what is the query complexity of this learning problem
    in the statistical query (SQ) model of Kearns (1998). We show that, as in the case of general PAC learning, the query complexity of
    attribute-efficient SQ learning of any concept class can be characterized by a combinatorial parameter of the concept class.
    The proposed question is then equivalent to estimating the value of this parameter for the concept class of halfspaces.
    A potentially simpler problem is to estimate this parameter for the concept class of decision lists, a subclass of halfspaces.}

    abstract = {In many learning problems, we attempt to infer \emph{global} structure in the interest of making \emph{local} predictions.  For example, we might try to infer the skills of the competitors in a tournament in order to predict who will win a match, or we might try to predict characteristics of users and films in order to predict which users will like which films.  In even relatively simple settings of this type, it is typically NP-hard to find the latent data which best explain some observations.  But do these complexity-theoretic obstructions actually prevent us from making good predictions?  Because each prediction depends on only a small number of variables, it might be possible to make good predictions without actually finding a good global assignment.  This may seem to be a purely technical distinction, but recent work has shown that several local prediction problems actually \emph{are} easy even though the corresponding global inference problem is hard.  The question we pose is: how general is this phenomenon?}

  pages     = {1295-1298},
  abstract  = {A number of online algorithms have been developed that have
small additional loss (regret) compared to the best
``shifting expert''. In this model, there is a set of experts and
the comparator is the best partition of the trial sequence
into a small number of segments, where the expert of
smallest loss is chosen in each segment.
The regret is typically defined for worst-case data / loss sequences.

There has been a recent surge of interest in online algorithms
that combine good worst-case guarantees with much improved performance on easy data.
A practically relevant class of easy data is the case
when the loss of each expert is iid
and the best and second best experts have a gap
between their mean loss. In the full information setting, the
FlipFlop algorithm by
De Rooij et al. (2014)
combines the best of the iid
optimal Follow-The-Leader (FL)
and the worst-case-safe Hedge algorithms,
whereas in the bandit information case SAO by
Bubeck and Slivkins (2012)
competes with the iid optimal UCB and the worst-case-safe EXP3.

We ask the same question for the shifting expert problem.
First, we ask what are the simple and efficient algorithms
for the shifting experts problem when the loss
sequence in each segment is iid with respect to a fixed but
unknown distribution. Second, we ask how to efficiently
unite the performance of such algorithms on easy data with worst-case robustness.

A particular intriguing open problem is the case when
the comparator shifts within a small subset of experts from a
large set under the assumption that the losses in each
segment are iid.}
