We consider a general framework for nonparametric Bayes joint modeling through mixture models that incorporate dependence across data types through a joint mixing measure.  The mixing measure is assigned a novel infinite tensor factorization (ITF) prior that allows flexible dependence in cluster allocation across data types.  The ITF prior is formulated as a tensor product of stick-breaking processes.  Focusing on a convenient special case corresponding to a Parafac factorization, we provide basic theory justifying the flexibility of the proposed prior.  Focusing on ITF mixtures of product kernels, we develop a  new Gibbs sampling algorithm for routine implementation relying on slice sampling. The methods are compared with alternative joint mixture models based on Dirichlet processes and related approaches through simulations and real data applications.},

We consider the cases of homoscedastic and heteroscedastic noise and carry out, in each case, upper bounds on the matching threshold of several estimators. This upper bounds are shown to be unimprovable in the homoscedastic setting. We also discuss the computational aspects of the estimators and provide some empirical evidence of their consistency on synthetic data-sets.},

However, MCMC for multinomial probit (MNP) models can be inefficient in practice due to high posterior dependence between latent variables and parameters, and to difficulties in efficiently sampling latent variables when there are more than two categories.  To address these problems, we propose a new class of diagonal orthant (DO) multinomial models.  The key characteristics of these models include conditional independence of the latent variables given model parameters, avoidance of arbitrary identifiability restrictions, and simple expressions for category probabilities. We show substantially improved computational efficiency and comparable predictive performance to MNP. },

In this paper, we propose a general framework for distributed estimation based on a maximum marginal likelihood (MML) approach. Each node independently computes a local estimate by maximizing a marginal likelihood defined with respect to data collected from its local neighborhood. Due to the non-convexity of the MML problem, we derive and consider solving a convex relaxation.  The local estimates are then combined into a global estimate without the need for iterative message-passing between neighborhoods.  We prove that this relaxed MML estimator is asymptotically consistent. Through numerical experiments on several synthetic and real-world data sets, we demonstrate that the two-hop version of the proposed estimator is significantly better than the one-hop version, and nearly closes the gap to the centralized maximum likelihood estimator in many situations.},

Here, we describe a novel Bayesian regression and Mondrian process model (BRAMP) for reconstructing species interaction networks from observed field data. BRAMP enables robust inference of species interactions considering autocorrelation in species abundances and allowing for variation in the interactions across space. We evaluate the model on spatially explicit simulated data, produced using a trophic niche model combined with stochastic population dynamics. We compare the model's performance against L1-penalized sparse regression (LASSO) and non-linear Bayesian networks with the BDe scoring scheme. Finally, we apply BRAMP to real ecological data.},

They offer surprisingly efficient inference, including sampling in $O(N^3)$ time and $O(N^2)$ space, where $N$ is the number of base items.  However, in some applications, $N$ may grow so large that sampling from a DPP becomes computationally infeasible. This is especially true in settings where the DPP kernel matrix cannot be represented by a linear decomposition of low-dimensional feature vectors. In these cases, we propose applying the Nystrom approximation to project the kernel matrix into a low-dimensional space. While theoretical guarantees for the Nystrom approximation in terms of standard matrix norms have been previously established, we are concerned with probabilistic measures, like total variation distance between the DPP generated by a kernel matrix and the one generated by its Nystrom approximation, that behave quite differently. In this paper we derive new error bounds for the Nystrom-approximated DPP and present empirical results to corroborate them. We then demonstrate the Nystrom-approximated DPP by applying it to a motion capture summarization task.},

   abstract = {Thompson Sampling is one of the oldest heuristics for multi-armed bandit problems. It is a randomized algorithm based on Bayesian ideas, and has recently generated significant interest after several studies demonstrated it to have comparable or better empirical performance compared to the state of the art methods. In this paper, we provide a novel regret analysis for Thompson Sampling that proves the first near-optimal problem-independent  bound of $O(\sqrt{NT\ln T})$ on the expected regret of this algorithm. Our novel martingale-based analysis techniques are conceptually simple, and easily extend to distributions other than the Beta distribution. For the version of Thompson Sampling that uses Gaussian priors, we prove a problem-independent bound of $O(\sqrt{NT\ln N})$ on the expected regret, and demonstrate the optimality of this bound by providing a matching lower bound. This lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{NT\ln N})$ is the first lower bound on the performance of a natural version of Thompson Sampling that is away from the general lower bound of $O(\sqrt{NT})$ for the multi-armed bandit problem. Our near-optimal problem-independent bounds for Thompson Sampling solve a COLT 2012 open problem of Chapelle and Li. Additionally, our techniques simultaneously provide the optimal problem-dependent bound of $(1+\epsilon)\sum_i \frac{\ln T}{d(\mu_i, \mu_1)}+O(\frac{N}{\epsilon^2})$ on the expected regret.  The optimal problem-dependent regret bound for this problem was first proven recently by Kaufmann et al. [2012].},

We show that this significantly improves the performance of DMC because 1) a population of chains has a higher chance of finding the modes in the distribution, 2) jumping between modes becomes easier due to the adaptation of their shapes, 3) computation is much more efficient due to parallelization across multiple processors. While the curse of dimensionality is a challenge for both DMC and regeneration, we find that their combination ameliorates this issue slightly. },

But in the ultrahigh dimensional regime, these approaches suffer from several problems, both computationally and statistically. To overcome these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel Hilbert space embedding based approach to independence screening for ultrahigh dimensional data sets. The proposed approach is model-free (i.e., no model assumption is made between response and predictors) and could handle non-standard (e.g., graphs) and multivariate outputs directly. We establish the sure screening property of the proposed approach in the ultrahigh dimensional regime, and experimentally demonstrate its advantages and superiority over other approaches on several synthetic and real data sets.},

We present a new sampling algorithm Qi that addresses these challenges using concepts from the field of program analysis. To solve the first challenge (getting diverse samples), we use a technique called symbolic execution to systematically explore all the paths in a program. In the case of programs with loops, we systematically explore all paths up to a given depth, and present theorems on error bounds on the estimates as a function of the path bounds used. To solve the second challenge (efficient samples with minimal rejection), we propagate observations backward through the program using the notion of Dijkstra's weakest preconditions and hoist these propagated conditions to condition elementary distributions during sampling. We present theorems explaining the mathematical properties of Qi, as well as empirical results from an implementation of the algorithm.},

We study this community reconstruction problem under several natural generative models, and make the following two contributions. First, in the context of social networks, where the signals are modeled as bounded-supported random variables, we design an efficient algorithm for recovering most members in $S$ with well-controlled false positive overhead, by utilizing the network structure for a large family of ``homogeneous'' generative models. This positive result is complemented by an information theoretic lower bound for the case where the network structure is unknown or the network is heterogeneous. Second, we consider the case in which the graph represents the protein interaction network, in which it is customary to consider signals that have unbounded support, we generalize our first contribution to give the first theoretical justification of why existing Steiner-tree type heuristics work well in practice.},

An equivalent measure of entropy is the Renyi entropy that depends on a constant $\alpha$.  This quantity can be estimated efficiently and unbiasedly from a low-dimensional synopsis called an $\alpha$-stable data sketch via the method of compressed counting.  An approximation to the Shannon entropy can be obtained from the Renyi entropy by taking alpha sufficiently close to 1. However, practical guidelines for parameter calibration with respect to $\alpha$ are lacking. We avoid this problem by showing that the random variables used in estimating the Renyi entropy can be transformed to have a proper distributional limit as $\alpha$ approaches 1: the maximally skewed, strictly stable distribution with $\alpha = 1$ defined on the entire real line.  We propose a family of asymptotically unbiased log-mean estimators of the Shannon entropy, indexed by a constant $\zeta > 0$, that can be computed in a single-pass algorithm to provide an additive approximation. We recommend the log-mean estimator with $\zeta = 1$ that has exponentially decreasing tail bounds on the error probability, asymptotic relative efficiency of 0.932, and near-optimal computational complexity.  },

   abstract = {In this paper we introduce deep Gaussian process (GP) models. Deep GPs are a deep belief network based on Gaussian process mappings. The data is modeled as the output of a multivariate GP. The inputs to that Gaussian process are then governed by another GP. A single layer model is equivalent to a standard GP or the GP latent variable model (GP-LVM). We perform inference in the model by approximate variational marginalization. This results in a strict lower bound on the marginal likelihood of the model which we use for model selection (number of layers and nodes per layer). Deep belief networks are typically applied to relatively large data sets using stochastic gradient descent for optimization. Our fully Bayesian treatment allows for the application of deep models even when data is scarce. Model selection by our variational bound shows that a five layer hierarchy is justified even when modelling a digit data set containing only 150 examples.},

Techniques based on gradient matching, which aim to minimize the discrepancy between the slope of a data interpolant and the derivatives predicted from the differential equations, offer a computationally appealing shortcut to the inference  problem. The present paper discusses a method based on nonparametric Bayesian statistics with Gaussian processes due to Calderhead et al. (2008), and shows how inference in this model can be substantially improved by consistently sampling from the joint distribution of the ODE parameters and GP hyperparameters. We demonstrate the efficiency of our adaptive gradient matching technique on three benchmark systems, and perform a detailed comparison with the method in Calderhead et al. (2008) and the explicit ODE integration approach, both in terms of parameter inference accuracy and in terms of computational efficiency.},

In this paper, we propose a continuous time model, TopicCascade, for topic-sensitive information diffusion networks, and infer the hidden diffusion networks and the topic dependent transmission rates from the observed time stamps and contents of cascades. One attractive property of the model is that its parameters can be estimated via a convex optimization which we solve with an efficient proximal gradient based block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm. In both synthetic and real-world data, we show that our method significantly improves over the previous state-of-the-art models in terms of both recovering the hidden diffusion networks and predicting the transmission times of memes.},

In many cases, however, interaction propensities -- and even the underlying mechanisms of interaction -- vary systematically across subgroups whose identities are unobserved. For static networks such heterogeneity has been treated via methods such as stochastic blockmodeling, which operate by assuming latent groups of individuals with similar tendencies in their group-wise interactions. Here we combine ideas from stochastic blockmodeling and continuous-time network models by positing a latent partition of the node set such that event dynamics within and between subsets evolve in potentially distinct ways. We illustrate the use of our model family by application to several forms of dyadic interaction data, including email communication and Twitter direct messages. Parameter estimates from the fitted models clearly reveal heterogeneity in the dynamics among groups of individuals. We also find that the fitted models have better predictive accuracy than both baseline models and relational event models that lack latent structure. },

An experimenter wants to learn a multivariate predictor of gene expressions based on successive biological samples assayed on mRNA arrays. She assays the whole genome on a few samples and from these assays she selects a small number of variables using Predictive Correlation Screening. To reduce assay cost, she subsequently assays only the selected variables on the remaining samples, to learn the predictor coefficients. We show superiority of Predictive Correlation Screening relative to LASSO and correlation learning (sometimes popularly referred to in the literature as marginal regression or simple thresholding) in terms of performance and computational complexity.},

More specifically, we investigate unsupervised link selection as follows: given a network, it selects a subset of informative links from the original network which enhance the quality of community structures. To achieve this goal, we use Ratio Cut size of a network as the quality measure. The resulting link selection approach can be formulated as a semi-definite programming problem. In order to solve it efficiently, we propose a backward elimination algorithm using sequential optimization. Experiments on benchmark network datasets illustrate the effectiveness of our method.},

One way to address this kind of data is training a nonlinear classifier such as kernel support vector machine (kernel SVM). However, the computational burden of kernel SVM limits its application to large scale datasets. In this paper, we propose a Clustered Support Vector Machine (CSVM), which tackles the data in a divide and conquer manner. More specifically, CSVM groups the data into several clusters, followed which it trains a linear support vector machine in each cluster to separate the data locally. Meanwhile, CSVM has an additional global regularization, which requires the weight vector of each local linear SVM aligning with a global weight vector. The global regularization leverages the information from one cluster to another, and avoids over-fitting in each cluster. We derive a data-dependent generalization error bound for CSVM, which explains the advantage of CSVM over linear SVM. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms linear SVM and some other related locally linear classifiers. It is also comparable to a fine-tuned kernel SVM in terms of prediction performance, while it is more efficient than kernel SVM.},

Unfortunately, training models with a large number of parameters remains a time consuming process. This paper shows that significant computational savings can be achieved by adding multiple diverse and highly violated constraints at every iteration of the cutting-plane algorithm. We show that generation of such diverse cutting-planes involves extracting diverse M-Best solutions from the loss-augmented score of the training instances. To find these diverse M-Best solutions, we employ a recently proposed algorithm [4]. Our experiments on image segmentation and protein side-chain prediction show that the proposed approach can lead to significant computational savings, e.g., $\sim 28\%$ reduction in training time.},

Specifically, we propose a recursive algorithm for estimating the Karcher expectation of an arbitrary distribution defined on Pn, and we show that the estimates computed by the recursive algorithm asymptotically converge in probability to the correct Karcher expectation.  The steps in the recursive algorithm mainly consist of making appropriate moves on geodesics in Pn, and the algorithm is simple to implement and it offers a tremendous gain in computation time of several orders in magnitude over existing non-recursive algorithms.  We elucidate the connection between the more familiar law of large numbers for real-valued random variables and the asymptotic convergence of the proposed recursive algorithm, and our result provides an example of a new form of law of large numbers for random variables taking values in a Riemannian manifold.  From the practical side, the computation of the mean of a collection of symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrices is a fundamental ingredient in many algorithms in machine learning, computer vision and medical imaging applications.  We report an experiment using the proposed recursive algorithm for K-means clustering, demonstrating the algorithm's efficiency, accuracy and stability.},

The framework is based on an information theoretic criterion, which favors objects that reduce the uncertainty of the visualization.

We introduce Structural Expectation Propagation (SEP), an extension of EP which can infer the structure of Bayesian networks having latent variables and missing data. SEP performs variational inference in a joint model of structure, latent variables, and parameters, offering two advantages: (i) it accounts for uncertainty in structure and parameter values when making local distribution updates (ii) it returns a variational distribution over network structures rather than a single network.

However, learning their structure and parameters or using them to answer queries is typically intractable.  One approach to making learning and inference tractable is to use approximations, such as pseudo-likelihood or approximate inference.  An alternate approach is to use a restricted class of models where exact inference is always efficient.  Previous work has explored low treewidth models, models with tree-structured features, and latent variable models.  In this paper, we introduce ACMN, the first ever method for learning efficient Markov networks with arbitrary conjunctive features.  The secret to ACMN's greater flexibility is its use of arithmetic circuits, a linear-time inference representation that can handle many high treewidth models by exploiting local structure.  ACMN uses the size of the corresponding arithmetic circuit as a learning bias, allowing it to trade off accuracy and inference complexity.  In experiments on 12 standard datasets, the tractable models learned by ACMN are more accurate than both tractable models learned by other algorithms and approximate inference in intractable models. },

   abstract = {\emph{Gaussian process regression} (GPR) is a powerful non-linear technique for Bayesian inference and prediction. One drawback is its O($N^3$) computational complexity for both prediction and hyperparameter estimation for $N$ input points which has led to much work in sparse GPR methods. In case that the covariance function is expressible as a \emph{tensor product kernel} (TPK) and the inputs form a multidimensional grid, it was shown that the costs for exact GPR can be reduced to a sub-quadratic function of $N$. We extend these exact fast algorithms to sparse GPR and remark on a connection to \emph{Gaussian process latent variable models} (GPLVMs). In practice, the inputs may also violate the multidimensional grid constraints so we pose and efficiently solve missing and extra data problems for both exact and sparse grid GPR. We demonstrate our method on synthetic, text scan, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data reconstructions.},

   abstract = {Graphical models are powerful in modeling a variety of applications. Computing the partition function of a graphical model is a typical inference problem and known as an NP-hard problem for general graphs. A few sampling algorithms like MCMC, Simulated Annealing Sampling (SAS), Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) are developed to address this challenging problem. This paper describes a Langevin Importance Sampling (LIS) algorithm to compute the partition function of a graphical model. LIS first performs a random walk in the configuration-temperature space guided by the Langevin equation and then estimates the partition function using all the samples generated during the random walk, as opposed to the other configuration-temperature sampling methods, which uses only the samples at a specific temperature. Experimental results show that LIS can obtain much more accurate partition function than the others tested on several different types of graphical models. LIS performs especially well on relatively large graph models or those with a large number of local optima.},

   abstract = {Thompson Sampling has recently been shown to achieve the lower bound on regret in the Bernoulli Multi-Armed Bandit setting. This bandit problem assumes stationary distributions for the rewards. It is often unrealistic to model the real world as a stationary distribution. In this paper we derive and evaluate algorithms using Thompson Sampling for a Switching Multi-Armed Bandit Problem. We propose a Thompson Sampling strategy equipped with a Bayesian change point mechanism to tackle this problem. We develop algorithms for a variety of cases with constant switching rate: when switching occurs all arms change (Global Switching), switching occurs independently for each arm (Per-Arm Switching), when the switching rate is known and when it must be inferred from data. This leads to a family of algorithms we collectively term Change-Point Thompson Sampling (CTS).  We show empirical results in 4 artificial environments, and 2 derived from real world data: news click-through and foreign exchange data, comparing them to some other bandit algorithms. In real world data CTS is the most effective.  },

We develop a novel last step minmax optimal algorithm in context of a drift. We analyze the algorithm in the worst-case regret framework and show that it maintains an average loss close to that of the best slowly changing sequence of linear functions, as long as the total of drift is sublinear. In some situations, our bound improves over existing bounds, and additionally the algorithm suffers logarithmic regret when there is no drift. We also build on the H1 filter and its bound, and develop and analyze a second algorithm for drifting setting. Synthetic simulations demonstrate the advantages of our algorithms in a worst-case constant drift setting.},

For this setting, recently the BLB algorithm has been proposed, which achieves regret of order $T^{2/3}$, provided that the given set of models is finite. Our first contribution is to extend this result to a countably infinite set of models. Moreover, the BLB regret bound suffers from an additive term that can be exponential in the diameter of the MDP involved, since the diameter has to be guessed. The algorithm we propose avoids  guessing the diameter, thus improving the regret bound.},

Gaussian process regression networks (GPRNs)  are flexible  and effective models to represent such complex adaptive output dependencies. However, inference in GPRNs is  intractable.  In this paper we propose two efficient variational inference methods for  GPRNs. The first method, GPRN-MF, adopts a mean-field approach with full Gaussians over the GPRN's parameters as its factorizing distributions. The second method, GPRN-NPV, uses a nonparametric  variational inference approach. We derive analytical forms for the evidence lower bound on both methods, which we use to learn the variational parameters and the hyper-parameters of the GPRN model. We obtain closed-form updates for the parameters of  GPRN-MF  and show that, while having relatively complex approximate posterior distributions, our approximate methods require the estimation of  O(N) variational parameters rather than O(N2) for the  parameters' covariances.  Our experiments on real data sets show that GPRN-NPV  may give a better approximation to the posterior distribution compared to GPRN-MF,  in terms of both predictive performance and stability. },

A "good" regularizer should perform well in both inference and optimization. In this paper, we prove that some non-convex regularizers can be such "good" regularizers. They are a family of sparsity-yielding penalties with proper Lipschitz subgradients. These regularizers keep the superiority of non-convex regularizers in inference. Their estimation conditions based on sparse eigenvalues are weaker than the convex regularizers. Meanwhile, if properly tuned, they behave like convex regularizers since standard proximal methods guarantee to give stationary solutions. These stationary solutions, if sparse enough, are identical to the global solutions. If the solution sequence provided by proximal methods is along a sparse path, the convergence rate to the global optimum is on the order of $1/k$ where $k$ is the number of iterations.},

Therefore, capturing the inherent statistical properties of the imaging data is critical for robust inference. Previous methods tackle this problem by exploiting either spatial sparsity or smoothness, which does not fully exploit the  structure in the data. Here we develop a flexible, hierarchical model designed to simultaneously capture spatial block sparsity and smoothness in neuroimaging data. We exploit a function domain representation for the high-dimensional small-sample data and develop efficient inference, parameter estimation, and prediction procedures. Empirical results with simulated and real neuroimaging data suggest that simultaneously capturing the block sparsity and smoothness properties can significantly improve structure recovery and predictive modeling performance.},

We propose a fast algorithm for approximating this likelihood, one whose computational cost is linear both in document length and in the number of topics. The method is a first-order approximation to the algorithm of Carvalho et al.

Despite the wide applicability of such a detection algorithm, there has been little success in the development of computationally feasible methods with provable theoretical guarantees.  To this end, we introduce the spanning tree wavelet basis over a graph, a localized basis that reflects the topology of the graph.  We first provide a necessary condition for asymptotic distinguishability of the null and alternative hypotheses.  Then we prove that for any spanning tree, we can hope to correctly detect signals in a low signal-to-noise regime using spanning tree wavelets.  We propose a randomized test, in which we use a uniform spanning tree in the basis construction.  Using electrical network theory, we show that the uniform spanning tree provides strong guarantees that in many cases match our necessary condition.  We prove that for edge transitive graphs, $k$-nearest neighbor graphs, and $\epsilon$-graphs we obtain nearly optimal performance with the uniform spanning tree wavelet detector.},

Different sensors have varying costs for acquisition, and these costs account for delay, throughput or monetary value. Consequently, we seek methods for maximizing performance of the system subject to budget constraints.  We formulate a multi-stage multi-class empirical risk objective and learn sequential decision functions from training data. We show that reject decision at each stage can be posed as supervised binary classification. We derive bounds for the VC dimension of the multi-stage system to quantify the generalization error.

Sufficient and necessary conditions to guarantee successful recovery of the support union are characterized. More specifically, it is shown that under certain conditions on the distributions of design matrices, if $n > c_{p1} \psi(B^*,\Sigma^{(1:K)})\log(p-s)$ where $c_{p1}$ is a constant and $s$ is the size of the support set, then the $l_1/l_2$ regularized Lasso correctly recovers the support union; and if $n < c_{p2} \psi(B^*,\Sigma^{(1:K)})\log(p-s)$ where $c_{p2}$ is a constant, then the $l_1/l_2$ regularized Lasso fails to recover the support union.

As a consquence we can provide a more intuitive derivation for the resulting convex relaxation than presented in the literature. Further, we show how to strengthen the relaxation by reparametrizing the potentials, hence convex relaxations for discrete-continuous inference does not share an important feature of LP relaxations for discrete labeling problems: incorporating unary potentials into higher order ones affects the quality of the relaxation. We argue that the convex model for discrete-continuous inference is very general and can be used as alternative for alternation-based methods often employed for such joint inference tasks. },

   abstract = {How will the behaviors of individuals in a social network be influenced by their neighbors, the authorities and the communities? Such knowledge is often hidden from us and we only observe its manifestation in the form of recurrent and time-stamped events occurring at the individuals involved. It is an important yet challenging problem to infer the network of social inference based on the temporal patterns of these historical events.   We propose a convex optimization approach to discover the hidden network of social influence by modeling the recurrent events at different individuals as multi-dimensional Hawkes processes. Furthermore, our estimation procedure, using nuclear and $\ell_1$ norm regularization simultaneously on the parameters, is able to take into account the prior knowledge of the presence of neighbor interaction, authority influence, and community coordination. To efficiently solve the problem, we also design an algorithm ADM4 which combines techniques of alternating direction method of multipliers and majorization minimization. We experimented with both synthetic and real world data sets, and showed that the proposed method can discover the hidden network more accurately and produce a better predictive model.},

   abstract = {Recovering a large low-rank matrix from highly corrupted, incomplete or sparse outlier overwhelmed observations is the crux of various intriguing statistical problems. We explore the power of "greedy bilateral (GreB)" paradigm in reducing both time and sample complexities for solving these problems. GreB models a low-rank variable as a bilateral factorization, and updates the left and right factors in a mutually adaptive and greedy incremental manner. We detail how to model and solve low-rank approximation, matrix completion and robust PCA in GreB's paradigm. On their MATLAB implementations, approximating a noisy 10000x10000 matrix of rank 500 with SVD accuracy takes 6s; MovieLens10M matrix of size 69878x10677 can be completed in 10s from 30\% of $10^7$ ratings with RMSE 0.86 on the rest 70\%; the low-rank background and sparse moving outliers in a 120x160 video of 500 frames are accurately separated in 1s. This brings 30 to 100 times acceleration in solving these popular statistical problems.},
