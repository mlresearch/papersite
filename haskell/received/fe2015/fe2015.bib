    abstract = {The problem of extracting features from given data is of critical
importance for successful application of machine learning. Feature
extraction, as usually understood, seeks an optimal transformation
from input data into a (typically real-valued) feature vector that can be used as an input for a learning algorithm. Over time, this problem has
been attacked using a growing number of diverse techniques that
originated in separate research communities, including feature
selection, dimensionality reduction, manifold learning, distance
metric learning and representation learning. The goal of this paper is
to contrast and compare feature extraction techniques coming from
different machine learning areas, discuss the modern challenges and
open problems in feature extraction and suggest novel solutions to
some of them.}

    pages = {19-29},
    abstract = {Kernel supervised principal component analysis (KSPCA) is a computationally efficient supervised feature extraction method that can learn non-linear transformations. We start the study of the statistical properties of KSPCA, providing the first bound on its sample complexity. This bound is dimension-independent, which justifies the good performance of KSPCA on high-dimensional data. Another observation is that in the kernelized version, the number of parameters of KSPCA grows linearly with the sample size. While this potentially increases the risk of over-fitting, KSPCA works well in practice. In this work, we justify this compelling characteristic of KSPCA by providing a guarantee indicating that KSPCA generalizes well even when the number of parameters is large, as long as they have small norms.}

    title = {Learning Sparse Metrics, One Feature at a Time},
    author = {Atzmon, Yuval, and Shalit, Uri and Chechik, Gal},
    pages = {30-48},
    abstract = {Learning distance metrics from data is a fundamental problem in machine learning and useful way to extract data-driven features by using the matrix root of a distance matrix. Finding a proper metric amounts to optimization over the cone of positive definite (PD) matrices. This optimization is difficult since restricting optimization to remain within the PD cone or repeatedly projecting to the cone is prohibitively costly.

Here we describe COMET, a block-coordinate descent procedure, which efficiently keeps the search within the PD cone, avoiding both costly projections and unnecessary computation of full gradients. COMET also continuously maintains the Cholesky root of the matrix, providing feature extraction and embedding of samples in a metric space. We further develop a structurally sparse variant of COMET, where only a small number of features interacts with other features. Sparse-COMET significantly accelerates both training and inference while improving interpretability.
 
As a block-coordinate descent procedure, COMET has fast convergence bounds showing linear convergence with high probability. When tested on benchmark datasets in a task of retrieving similar images and similar text documents, COMET has significantly better precision than competing projection-free methods. Furthermore, sparse-COMET achieves almost identical precision as dense-COMET in document classification, while running 4.5 times faster, maintaining a 0.5\% sparsity level, and outperforming competing methods both in precision and in run time. }

    title = {Stage-wise Training: An Improved Feature Learning Strategy for Deep Models},
    author = {Barshan, Elnaz and Fieguth, Paul},
    pages = {49-59},
    abstract = {Deep neural networks currently stand at the state of the art for many machine learning applications, yet there still remain limitations in the training of such networks because of their very high parameter dimensionality. In this paper we show that network training performance can be improved using a stage-wise learning strategy, in which the learning process is broken down into a number of related sub-tasks that are completed stage-by-stage. The idea is to inject the information to the network \textit{gradually} so that in the early stages of training the ``coarse-scale'' properties of the data are captured while the ``finer-scale'' characteristics are learned in later stages. Moreover, the solution found in each stage serves as a prior to the next stage, which produces a regularization effect and enhances the generalization of the learned representations. We show that decoupling the classifier layer from the feature extraction layers of the network is necessary, as it alleviates the diffusion of gradient and over-fitting problems.  Experimental results in the context of image classification support these claims.}

It is then applied to multiple essential facial regions to obtain multi-channel deep facial representations for face recognition. The effecacy of the proposed feature representations is validated on both controlled (i.e., extended Yale- B, Yale, and AR) and uncontrolled (PubFig) benchmark face databases. Experimental results show its effectiveness.}

Based on partitioning the support of $Z$, a simple local average is used to  approximate the response surface $g(Z)$. The model can be estimated via least squares and no tuning parameter is needed. The proposed method seeks to strike a balance between computation
burden and efficiency of the estimators while minimizing model bias. The desired theoretical properties of the proposed estimators are established.  Moreover, since the proposed method bypasses data-driven bandwith selection of traditional nonparametric methods, it avoids the further efficiency loss due to computation burden.}

    abstract = {We present a framework for feature extraction and mode decomposition of spatiotemporal data generated by ergodic dynamical systems. Unlike feature extraction techniques based on kernel operators, our approach is to construct feature maps using eigenfunctions of the Koopman group of unitary operators governing the dynamical evolution of observables and probability measures. We compute the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Koopman group through a Galerkin scheme applied to time-ordered data without requiring a priori knowledge of the dynamical evolution equations. This scheme employs a data-driven set of basis functions on the state space manifold, computed through the diffusion maps algorithm and a variable-bandwidth kernel designed to enforce orthogonality with respect to the invariant measure of the dynamics. The features extracted via this approach have strong timescale separation, favorable predictability properties, and high smoothness on the state space manifold. The extracted features are also invariant under weakly restrictive changes of observation modality. We apply this scheme to a synthetic dataset featuring superimposed traveling waves in a one-dimensional periodic domain and satellite observations of organized convection in the tropical atmosphere.}

Our tensor decomposition algorithm is based on the popular alternating least squares (ALS) method, but with additional shift invariance constraints on the factors. We demonstrate that each ALS update can be computed efficiently using simple operations such as fast Fourier transforms and matrix multiplications. Our algorithm converges to models with better reconstruction error and is much faster, compared to the popular alternating minimization heuristic, where the filters  and activation maps are alternately updated.}

In this paper, we build upon a novel framework called FEAST(Feature ExtrAction using Score function Tensors) which incorporates   generative models  for discriminative learning. FEAST considers a novel class of matrix and tensor-valued feature transform, which can be pre-trained using unlabeled samples. It uses an efficient algorithm for extracting discriminative information, given these pre-trained features and labeled samples for any related task. The class of   features it adopts are based on higher-order score functions, which capture local variations in the probability density function of the input.  We employ efficient spectral decomposition algorithms (on matrices and tensors) for extracting discriminative components. The advantage of employing tensor-valued features is that we can extract richer discriminative information in the form of overcomplete representations (where number of discriminative features is greater than input dimension). In this paper, we provide preliminary experiment results on real datasets.}

  pages={145-159},
  abstract={We explore ways of applying a prior on the covariance matrix of a Gaussian Process (GP)

Wishart Process and Inverse Wishart Process, boil down to a two-layer feed-forward net-
work of GPs with a particular kernel function on the neuron at the output layer. Both
of these models perform supervised manifold learning and target prediction jointly. Also,
the resultant kernel functions of both of these priors lead to feature maps of finite dimen-
sionality. Motivated by this fact, we promote replacing these kernels with the Radial Basis
Function (RBF), which gives an infinite dimensional feature map, enhancing the model flex-
ibility. We demonstrate on one benchmark task and two challenging medical image analysis
tasks that our GP network with RBF kernel largely outperforms the earlier two covariance
priors. We show also that it straightforwardly allows non-linear combination of different
data views, leading to state-of-the-art multiple kernel learning only as a by-product.}

However, in practice the network architecture has to be manually set by domain experts, generally by a costly trial and error procedure, which often accounts for a large portion of the final system performance. We view this as a limitation and propose a novel training algorithm that automatically optimizes network architecture, by progressively increasing model complexity and then eliminating model redundancy by selectively removing parameters at training time. For convolutional neural networks, our method relies on iterative split/merge clustering of convolutional kernels interleaved by stochastic gradient descent. We present a training algorithm and experimental results on three different vision tasks, showing improved performance compared to similarly sized hand-crafted architec- tures.}

    abstract = {Recent successes in training large, deep neural networks (DNNs) have prompted active investigation into the underlying representations learned on their intermediate layers. Such research is difficult because it requires making sense of non-linear computations performed by millions of learned parameters. However, despite the difficulty, such research is valuable because it increases our ability to understand current models and training algorithms and thus create improved versions of them. We argue for the value of investigating whether neural networks exhibit what we call convergent learning, which is when separately trained DNNs learn features that converge to span similar spaces. We further begin research into this question by introducing two techniques to approximately align neurons from two networks: a bipartite matching approach that makes one-to-one assignments between neurons and a spectral clustering approach that finds many-to-many mappings. Our initial approach to answering this question reveals many interesting, previously unknown properties of neural networks, and we argue that future research into the question of convergent learning will yield many more. The insights described here include (1) that some features are learned reliably in multiple networks, yet other features are not consistently learned; and (2) that units learn to span low-dimensional subspaces and, while these subspaces are common to multiple networks, the specific basis vectors learned are not; (3) that the  average activation values of neurons vary considerably within a network, yet the mean activation values across different networks converge to an almost identical distribution.}

We demonstrate a novel, perhaps the first application of deep learning in mechanical design, specifically to learn complex microfluidic flow patterns in order to solve inverse problems in fluid mechanics. A recent discovery showed the ability to control the fluid deformations in a microfluidic channel by placing a sequence of pillars. This provides a fundamental tool for numerous material science, manufacturing and biological applications. However, designing pillar sequences for user-defined deformations is practically infeasible as the current process requires laborious and time-consuming design iterations in a very large, highly nonlinear design space that can have as large as $10^{15}$ possibilities. We demonstrate that hierarchical feature extraction can potentially lead to a scalable design tool via learning semantic representations from a relatively small number of flow pattern examples. The paper compares the performances of pre-trained deep neural networks and deep convolutional neural networks as well as their learnt features. We show that a balanced training data generation process with respect to a metric on the output space improves the feature extraction performance. Overall, the deep learning based design process is shown to expedite the current state-of-the-art design approaches by more than $600$ times.}

principle is proposed for adaptively selecting features during online

The approach eliminates noisy or useless features from the
optimization process, leading to improved loss.
Several algorithmic variations on the approach are presented.  They
are based on using a Bayesian mixture in each of the dimensions of the feature space.  By
utilizing the MDL principle, the mixture reduces the dimensionality
of the feature space to its subspace with the lowest loss.  Bounds on the loss, derived, show that
the loss for that subspace is essentially achieved.
The approach can be tuned for trading off between model size and the loss incurred.
Empirical results on large scale real-world systems demonstrate how it improves such tradeoffs.
Huge model size reductions can be achieved with no loss
in performance relative to standard techniques, while moderate loss
improvements (translating to large regret
improvements) are achieved with moderate size reductions.
The results also demonstrate that overfitting is eliminated by this
approach.}
