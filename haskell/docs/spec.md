## JMLR W&CP Proceedings Specification

_Version 1.0 -- May 22nd, 2013_

To publish a proceedings with JMLR W&CP, the organisers will need to provide the JMLR W&CP Production Editor (Mark Reid) with:

1. A BibTeX file (described below) with the details of each paper in the proceedings.
2. A collection of PDF files (and, optionally, supplementary files).

The following specification is for simple conference proceedings that consist of one or more papers that are to be displayed in page order with links to associated PDF and supplementary files. If you need any clarifications, or need to publish proceedings with special sections, awards, multiple cycles, or other features, please email <mark.reid@anu.edu.au>.


### The BibTeX file

**Note**: _The contents of each field must be valid BibTeX (i.e., make sure special characters are escaped correctly)_.

All of the conference and paper details are contained in a single BibTeX file. You can name it whatever you like but we suggest you use some association with the conference name (e.g., `icml13.bib`)

There are two types of entry that must appear in the BibTeX file:

* There **must** be a single `@Proceedings` entry with the conference details. It **must** include the following fields:
	- `booktitle`: the long name of the conference
	- `shortname` the abbreviation for the conference (without the year, e.g., ICML)
	- `year` : the year of the conference (e.g., 2013)
	- `editor`: the editors' names (in "Lastname, Firstnames" format, separated by "and")
	- `volume`: the JMLR W&CP number assigned to your conference
	-  Other fields may be present in the `@Proceedings` entry but these will be ignored at present.

* There **must** be at one `@InProceedings` entry for each paper. Each entry **must** have the following fields:
	- `title`: The title of the paper
	- `author`: The paper's authors in "Lastname, Firstnames" format, separated by "and"
	- `pages`: The page numbers in "startpage--endpage" format
	- `abstract`: The paper's abstract in valid LaTeX
	- Other fields may also appear in the `@InProceedings` entries but these will be ignored at present.

The identifiers should be of the form `lastnameYY` where `lastname` is the lowercase last name of the first author and `YY` is the last two digits of the year of the conference. If two papers share the same identifier under this scheme, they must be disambiguated by appending one of `a`, `b`, `c`, etc. to the conflicting identifiers (e.g., `reid12a` and `reid12b`)

### The Papers and Supplementary Material

The paper PDFs must have a filename corresponding to the identifier of its BibTeX entry. For example, the PDF for the `reid12a` entry must have filename `reid12a.pdf`. These should all appear in the same directory as the BibTeX file describing all the entries.

Make sure all supplementary filenames for a paper with ID `lastnameYY` begin with the same ID but end with the suffix `-supp` (e.g., The PDF supplementary should be named `lastnameYY-supp.pdf`). These should appear in the same directory as the BibTeX file you provide us. Use whichever file extension is most appropriate (e.g., `.pdf` for PDF files, `.zip` for zipped files, `.mov` for movies, etc.)

For example, suppose the paper with identifier `reid12b` had a supplementary PDF file with proofs. You should give us a file named `reid12b-supp.pdf`. The generated site for the `reid12b` entry will contain a link titled `supplementary` to the files `reid12b-supp.pdf`.

## Sample BibTeX file and papers

Below is a sample of a BibTeX file for the 2nd International Conference on Examples (ICE'13) in 2013. It has been given volume number 57 and is edited by Jane Smith and Joe Bloggs. It contains three papers. It was provided as part of a gzipped tarball[^1] `ice13.tar.gz` along with the PDF and supplementary files. The contents of the tarball is:

- `ice13.bib` (The BibTeX file below)
- `jones13a.pdf`
- `jones13a-supp.pdf` (Supplementary proofs for `jones13a`)
- `jones13b.pdf`
- `smythe13.pdf`
- `smythe13-supp.zip` (Supplementary code and data for `smythe13`)

[^1]: Note: gzipped tarballs are not the only way you can send material. For larger conferences, we recommend sharing a Dropbox directory or otherwise putting the files up on a server we can have access to.

The contents of the BibTeX file `ice13.bib` is:
