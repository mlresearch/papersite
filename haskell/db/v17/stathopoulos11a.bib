  abstract = {In this paper we present new probabilistic ranking functions for content based image retrieval. Our methodology generalises previous approaches and is based on the predictive densities of generative probabilistic models modelling the density of image features. We evaluate the proposed methodology and compare it against two state of the art image retrieval systems using a well known image collection.},
