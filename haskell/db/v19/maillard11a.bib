  abstract = {We consider a Kullback-Leibler-based algorithm for the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem in the case of distributions with finite supports(not necessarily known beforehand), whose asymptotic regret matches the lower bound of \citet{Burnetas96}. Our contribution is to provide a finite-time analysis of this algorithm;we get bounds whose main terms are smaller than the ones of previously known algorithms with finite-time analyses (like UCB-type algorithms).},
