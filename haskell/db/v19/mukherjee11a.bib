  abstract = {The AdaBoost algorithm of \citet{FreundSc97} was designed to combine  many ``weak'' hypotheses that perform slightly better than a random  guess into a ``strong'' hypothesis that has very low error.  We  study the rate at which AdaBoost iteratively converges to the  minimum of the ``exponential loss'' with a fast rate of  convergence. Our proofs do not require a weak-learning assumption,  nor do they require that minimizers of the exponential loss are  finite. Specifically, our first result shows that at iteration $t$,  the exponential loss of AdaBoost's computed parameter vector will be  at most $\varepsilon$ more than that of any parameter vector of  $\ell_1$-norm bounded by $B$ in a number of rounds that is bounded  by a polynomial in $B$ and $1/\varepsilon$. We also provide rate  lower bound examples showing a polynomial dependence on these  parameters is necessary.  Our second result is that within  $C/\varepsilon$ iterations, AdaBoost achieves a value of the  exponential loss that is at most $\varepsilon$ more than the best  possible value, where $C$ depends on the dataset. We show that this  dependence of the rate on $\varepsilon$ is optimal up to constant  factors, i.e. at least $\Omega(1/\varepsilon)$ rounds are necessary  to achieve within $\varepsilon$ of the optimal exponential loss.},
