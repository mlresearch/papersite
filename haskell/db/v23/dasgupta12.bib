  abstract = {This paper studies nearest neighbor classification in a model where unlabeled data points arrive in a stream, and the learner decides, for each one, whether to ask for its label. Are there generic ways to augment or modify any selective sampling strategy so as to ensure the consistency of the resulting nearest neighbor classifier?},
