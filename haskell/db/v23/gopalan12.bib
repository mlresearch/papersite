  abstract = {We present a simple query-algorithm for learning arbitrary functions of k halfspaces under any product distribution on the Boolean hypercube. Our algorithms learn any function of k halfspaces to within accuracy ε in time \emph{O((nk/ε)^{k+1})} under any product distribution on {0, 1}^{\emph{n}} using read-once branching programs as a hypothesis. This gives the first \emph{poly(n, 1/ε)} algorithm for learning even the intersection of 2 halfspaces under the uniform distribution on {0, 1}^{\emph{n}} previously known algorithms had an exponential dependence either on the accuracy parameter ε or the dimension \emph{n}. To prove this result, we identify a new structural property of Boolean functions that yields learnability with queries: that of having a small prefix cover.},
