  abstract = {We prove a new structural lemma for partial Boolean functions \emph{f}, which we call the \emph{seed lemma} for \emph{DNF}. Using the lemma, we give the first subexponential algorithm for proper learning of poly(\emph{n})-term DNF in Angluin's Equivalence Query (EQ) model. The algorithm has time and query complexity 2^{(Õ√\emph{n})}, which is optimal. We also give a new result on certificates for DNF-size, a simple algorithm for properly PAC-learning DNF, and new results on EQ-learning log \emph{n}-term DNF and decision trees.},
