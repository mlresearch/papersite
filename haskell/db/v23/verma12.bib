  abstract = {Low dimensional embeddings of manifold data have gained popularity in the last decade. However, a systematic finite sample analysis of manifold embedding algorithms largely eludes researchers. Here we present two algorithms that, given access to just the samples, embed the underlying $n$- dimensional manifold into $R^d$ (where $d$ only depends on some key manifold properties such as its intrinsic dimension, volume and curvature) and \emph{guarantee} to approximately preserve all interpoint geodesic distances.},
