  abstract = {In the active learning framework, a modified query learning algorithm benefiting by a nontrivial helpful labeling is able to learn automata with a reduced number of queries. In extremis, there exists a helpful labeling allowing the algorithm to learn automata even without counterexamples. We also review the correction queries defining them as particular types of labeling. We introduce minimal corrections, maximal corrections, and random corrections. An experimental approach compares the performance and limitations of various types of queries and corrections. The results show that algorithms using corrections require fewer queries in most of the cases.},
