  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce methods that we used to solve problems from the sequence prediction competition called SPiCe. We train a model from sequences in train data on each problem, and then predict a next symbol following each sequence in test data. We implement several methods to solve these problems. The experiment results show that XGBoost and neural network approaches have good performance overall.},
