  abstract = {Topic models have achieved significant successes in analyzing large-scale text corpus. In practical applications, we are always confronted with the challenge of model selection, i.e., how to appropriately set the number of topics.  Following the recent advances in topic models  via tensor decomposition, we make a first attempt to provide theoretical analysis on model selection in latent Dirichlet allocation. With mild conditions, we derive the upper bound and lower bound on the number of topics given a text collection of finite size. Experimental results demonstrate that our bounds are correct and tight. Furthermore, using Gaussian mixture model as an example, we show that our methodology can be easily generalized to model selection analysis in other latent models.},
