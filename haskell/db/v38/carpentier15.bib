  abstract = {We consider the setting of linear regression in high dimension. We focus on the problem of constructing adaptive and honest confidence sets for the sparse parameter \theta, i.e. we want to construct a confidence set for theta that contains theta with high probability, and that is as small as possible. The l_2 diameter of a such confidence set should depend on the sparsity S of \theta - the larger S, the wider the confidence set. However, in practice, S is unknown. This paper focuses on constructing a confidence set for \theta which contains \theta with high probability, whose diameter is adaptive to the unknown sparsity S, and which is implementable in practice.},
