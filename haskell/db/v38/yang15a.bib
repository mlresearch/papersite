  abstract = {Nonlinear dimensionality reduction by manifold embedding has become a popular and powerful approach both for visualization and as preprocessing for predictive tasks, but more efficient optimization algorithms are still crucially needed.  Majorization-Minimization (MM) is a promising approach that monotonically decreases the cost function, but it remains unknown how to tightly majorize the manifold embedding objective functions such that the resulting MM algorithms are efficient and robust. We propose a new MM procedure that yields fast MM algorithms for a wide variety of manifold embedding problems. In our majorization step, two parts of the cost function are respectively upper bounded by quadratic and Lipschitz surrogates, and the resulting upper bound can be minimized in closed form. For cost functions amenable to such QL-majorization, the MM yields monotonic improvement and is efficient: in experiments the newly developed MM algorithms outperform five state-of-the-art optimization approaches in manifold embedding tasks.},
