  abstract = {Gaussian processes have been used in different application domains such as classification, regression etc. In this paper we show that they can also be employed as a universal tool for developing a large variety of Bayesian statistical hypothesis tests for regression functions. In particular, we will use GPs for testing whether (i) two functions are equal; (ii) a function is monotone (even accounting for seasonality effects); (iii) a function is periodic; (iv) two functions are proportional. By simulation studies, we will show that, beside being more flexible, GP tests are also competitive in terms of performance with state-of-art algorithms.},
