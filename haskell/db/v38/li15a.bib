  abstract = {When learning, such as classification, is used in adversarial settings, such as intrusion detection, intelligent adversaries will attempt to evade the resulting policies. The literature on adversarial machine learning aims to develop learning algorithms which are robust to such adversarial evasion, but exhibits two significant limitations: a) failure to account for operational constraints and b) a restriction that decisions are deterministic. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a conceptual separation between learning, used to infer attacker preferences, and operational decisions, which account for adversarial evasion, enforce operational constraints, and naturally admit randomization. Our approach gives rise to an intractably large linear program. To overcome scalability limitations, we introduce a novel method for estimating a compact parity basis representation for the operational decision function. Additionally, we develop an iterative constraint generation approach which embeds adversary's best response calculation, to arrive at a scalable algorithm for computing near-optimal randomized operational decisions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.},
