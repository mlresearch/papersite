  abstract = {A hierarchical gamma process infinite edge partition model is proposed to factorize the binary adjacency matrix of an unweighted undirected relational network under a  Bernoulli-Poisson link. The model describes  both homophily and stochastic equivalence, and is scalable to  big sparse networks by focusing its computation on  pairs of linked nodes. It can not only discover overlapping communities and inter-community interactions, but also predict missing edges. A simplified version omitting inter-community interactions is also provided and we reveal its  interesting connections to existing models. The number of communities is automatically inferred in a nonparametric Bayesian manner, and efficient  inference via Gibbs sampling is derived using novel data augmentation techniques. Experimental results on four real networks demonstrate the models' scalability and state-of-the-art performance.},
