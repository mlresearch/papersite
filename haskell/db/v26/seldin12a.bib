  abstract = {We develop a new tool for data-dependent analysis of the   exploration-exploitation trade-off in learning under limited   feedback. Our tool is based on two main ingredients. The first   ingredient is a new concentration inequality that makes it possible   to control the concentration of weighted averages of multiple   (possibly uncountably many) simultaneously evolving and   interdependent martingales. The second ingredient is an application of this inequality to the exploration-exploitation trade-off via importance weighted sampling. We apply the new tool to the stochastic multiarmed bandit problem, however, the main importance of this paper is the development and understanding of the new tool rather than improvement of existing algorithms for stochastic multiarmed bandits. In the follow-up work we demonstrate that the new tool can improve over state-of-the-art in structurally richer problems, such as stochastic multiarmed bandits with side information.},
