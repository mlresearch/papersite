  abstract = {Due to their open and anonymous nature, online social networks are
particularly vulnerable to Sybil attacks. In recent years, there
has been a rising interest in leveraging social network
topological structures to combat Sybil attacks. Unfortunately, due
to their strong dependency on unrealistic assumptions, existing
graph-based Sybil defense mechanisms suffer from high false
detection rates. In this paper, we focus on enhancing those
mechanisms by considering additional graph structural information
underlying social networks. Our solutions are based on our novel
understanding and interpretation of Sybil detection as the problem
of partially labeled classification. Specifically, we first
propose an effective graph pruning technique to enhance the
robustness of existing Sybil defense mechanisms against target
attacks, by utilizing the local structural similarity between
neighboring nodes in a social network. Second, we design a
domain-specific graph regularization method to further improve the
performance of those mechanisms by exploiting the relational
property of the social network. Experimental results on four
popular online social network datasets demonstrate that our
proposed techniques can significantly improve the detection
accuracy over the original Sybil defense mechanisms.},
