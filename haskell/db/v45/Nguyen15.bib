  abstract = {Supervised learning in machine learning concerns inferring an underlying
relation between covariate $\bx$ and target $y$ based on training
covariate-target data. It is traditionally assumed that training data and test data, on which the
generalization performance of a learning algorithm is measured, follow the same
probability distribution. However, this standard assumption is often violated in
many real-world applications such as computer vision, natural language
processing, robot control, or survey design, due to intrinsic non-stationarity
of the environment or inevitable sample selection bias. This situation is
called \emph{dataset shift} and has attracted a great deal of attention
recently. In the paper, we consider supervised learning problems under the
\emph{target shift} scenario, where the target marginal distribution $p(y)$
changes between the training and testing phases, while the target-conditioned
covariate distribution $p(\bx|y)$ remains unchanged. Although various methods
for mitigating target shift in classification (a.k.a. \emph{class prior change})
have been developed so far, few methods can be applied to continuous targets. In
this paper, we propose methods for continuous target shift adaptation in
regression and conditional density estimation. More specifically, our
contribution is a novel importance weight estimator for continuous targets.
Through experiments, the usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated.},
