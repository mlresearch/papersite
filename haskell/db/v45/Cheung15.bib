  abstract = {Proximal average (PA) is an approximation technique proposed recently to handle nonsmooth composite regularizer in empirical risk minimization problem. For nonsmooth composite regularizer, it is often difficult to directly derive the corresponding proximal update when solving with popular proximal update. While traditional approaches resort to complex splitting methods like ADMM, proximal average provides an alternative, featuring the tractability of implementation and theoretical analysis. Nevertheless, compared to SDCA-ADMM and SAG-ADMM which are examples of ADMM-based methods achieving faster convergence rate and low per-iteration complexity, existing PA-based approaches either converge slowly (e.g. PA-ASGD) or suffer from high per-iteration cost (e.g. PA-APG). In this paper, we therefore propose a new PA-based algorithm called PA-SAGA, which is optimal in both convergence rate and per-iteration cost, by incorporating into incremental gradient-based framework.
