  abstract = {Deep neural networks have achieved great successes on various machine learning tasks, however, there are many open fundamental questions to be answered. In this paper, we tackle the problem of quantifying the quality of learned wights of different networks with possibly different architectures, going beyond considering the final classification error as the only metric. We introduce \emph{Extended Data Jacobian Matrix} to help analyze properties of networks of various structures, finding that, the spectrum of the extended data jacobian matrix is a strong discriminating factor for networks of different structures and performance. Based on such observation, we propose a novel regularization method, which manages to improve the network performance comparably to dropout, which in turn verifies the observation.},
