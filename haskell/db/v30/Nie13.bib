  abstract = {Boosting algorithms can be viewed as a zero-sum game. At each iteration a new column / hypothesis is chosen from a game matrix representing the entire hypotheses class. 
There are algorithms for which the gap between the value of the sub-matrix (the $t$ columns chosen so far) and the value of the entire game matrix is $O(\sqrt{\frac{\log n}{t}})$.  A matching lower bound has been shown for random game matrices for $t$ up to $n^\alpha$ where $\alpha \in (0,\frac{1}{2})$.  We conjecture that with Hadamard matrices we can build a certain game matrix for which the game value grows at the slowest possible rate for $t$ up to a fraction of $n$.},
