  abstract = {We propose a version of the follow-the-perturbed-leader online prediction algorithm in which the cumulative losses are perturbed by independent symmetric random walks. The forecaster is shown to achieve an expected regret of the optimal order $O(\sqrt{n \log N})$ where $n$ is the time horizon and $N$ is the number of experts. More importantly, it is shown that the forecaster changes its prediction at most $O(\sqrt{n \log N})$ times, in expectation. We also extend the analysis to online combinatorial optimization and show that even in this more general setting, the forecaster rarely switches between experts while having a regret of near-optimal order. },
