  abstract = {We investigate the label complexity of active learning under some smoothness assumptions on the data-generating process.We propose a procedure, PLAL, for ``activising'' passive, sample-based learners. The procedure takes an unlabeledsample, queries the labels of some of its members, and outputs a full labeling of that sample. Assuming the data satisfies ``Probabilistic Lipschitzness'', a notion of clusterability, we show that for several common learning paradigms, applying our procedure as a preprocessing leads to provable label complexity reductions (over any ``passive''learning algorithm, under the same data assumptions). Our labeling procedure is simple and easy to implement. We complement our theoretical findings with experimental validations.},
