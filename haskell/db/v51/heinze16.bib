  abstract = {We present DUAL-LOCO, a communication-efficient algorithm for distributed statistical estimation. DUAL-LOCO assumes that the data is distributed across workers according to the features rather than the samples. It requires only a single round of communication where low-dimensional random projections are used to approximate the dependencies between features available to different workers. We show that DUAL-LOCO has bounded approximation error which only depends weakly on the number of workers. We compare DUAL-LOCO against a state-of-the-art distributed optimization method on a variety of real world datasets and show that it obtains better speedups while retaining good accuracy. In particular, DUAL-LOCO allows for fast cross validation as only part of the algorithm depends on the regularization parameter.},
