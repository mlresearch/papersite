  abstract = {In this paper, we present a new estimator for precision matrix in high dimensional Gaussian graphical models. At the core of the proposed estimator is a collection of node-wise linear regression with nonconvex penalty. In contrast to existing estimators for Gaussian graphical models with $O(s\sqrt{\log d/n})$ estimation error bound in terms of spectral norm, where $s$ is the maximum degree of a graph, the proposed estimator could attain $O(s/\sqrt{n}+\sqrt{\log d/n})$ spectral norm based convergence rate in the best case, and it is no worse than exiting estimators in general. In addition, our proposed estimator enjoys the oracle property under a milder condition than existing estimators. We show through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets that our estimator outperforms the state-of-the art estimators.},
