  abstract = {We extend the  $\ell_2$-consistency result of (Meinshausen and Yu 2008) from the Lasso to  the group Lasso. Our main theorem shows that the group Lasso  achieves estimation consistency under a mild condition and an asymptotic upper bound on the number of selected variables can be obtained.  As a result, we can apply the nonnegative garrote procedure to the group Lasso result to obtain an estimator which is simultaneously  estimation  and variable selection consistent.  In particular,  our setting allows both the number of groups and the number of variables per  group increase and thus is applicable to high-dimensional problems.  We also provide   estimation consistency analysis for a version of the sparse additive models with increasing dimensions. Some finite-sample results are also reported.},
