  abstract = {We present a novel method for estimating tree-structured covariance matrices directly from observed  continuous data. A representation of these classes of matrices as linear combinations  of rank-one matrices indicating object partitions is used to formulate estimation as  instances of well-studied numerical optimization problems.    In particular, our estimates are based on projection, where the covariance estimate  is the nearest tree-structured covariance matrix to an observed sample covariance matrix.  The problem is posed as a linear or quadratic mixed-integer program (MIP) where  a setting of the integer variables in the MIP specifies a set of tree topologies of the structured  covariance matrix. We solve these problems to optimality using efficient and robust existing MIP solvers.    We present a case study in phylogenetic analysis of expression in yeast gene families and a comparison using simulated data to distance-based tree estimating procedures.},
