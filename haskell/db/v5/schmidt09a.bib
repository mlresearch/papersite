  abstract = {An optimization algorithm for minimizing a smooth function over a    convex set is described.  Each iteration of the method computes a    descent direction by minimizing, over the original constraints, a    diagonal plus low-rank quadratic approximation to the function.  The    quadratic approximation is constructed using a limited-memory    quasi-Newton update.  The method is suitable for large-scale    problems where evaluation of the function is substantially more    expensive than projection onto the constraint set.  Numerical    experiments on one-norm regularized test problems indicate that the    proposed method is competitive with state-of-the-art methods such as    bound-constrained L-BFGS and orthant-wise descent. We further show    that the method generalizes to a wide class of problems, and     substantially improves on state-of-the-art methods for problems such    as learning the structure of Gaussian graphical models and Markov random    fields.},
