  abstract = {Recently, researchers have investigated novel dual representations  as a basis for dynamic programming and reinforcement learning algorithms.  Although the convergence properties of classical dynamic programming  algorithms have been established for dual representations, temporal  difference learning algorithms have not yet been analyzed.  In this paper,  we study the convergence properties of temporal difference learning using  dual representations.  We contribute significant progress by proving the  convergence of dual temporal difference learning with eligibility traces.  Experimental results suggest that the dual algorithms seem to demonstrate  empirical benefits over standard primal algorithms.},
