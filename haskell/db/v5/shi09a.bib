  abstract = {We propose hashing to facilitate efficient kernels. This generalizes    previous work using sampling and we show a principled way to compute    the kernel matrix for data streams and sparse feature    spaces. Moreover, we give deviation bounds from the exact kernel    matrix. This has applications to estimation on strings and graphs.},
