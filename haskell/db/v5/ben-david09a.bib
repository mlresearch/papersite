  abstract = {We define a novel, basic, unsupervised learning problem - learning  the lowest density homogeneous hyperplane separator of an  unknown probability distribution.  This task is relevant to several  problems in machine learning, such as semi-supervised learning and  clustering stability.  We investigate the question of existence of a  universally consistent algorithm for this problem. We propose two  natural learning paradigms and prove that, on input unlabeled random  samples generated by any member of a rich family of distributions,  they are guaranteed to converge to the optimal separator for that  distribution. We complement this result by showing that no learning  algorithm for our task can achieve uniform learning rates (that are  independent of the data generating distribution).},
