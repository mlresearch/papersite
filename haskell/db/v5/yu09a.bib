  abstract = {Labels are often expensive to get, and this motivates \emph{active learning} which chooses the most informative samples for label  acquisition. In this paper we study \emph{active sensing} in a  multi-view setting, motivated from many problems where grouped  features are also expensive to obtain and need to be acquired (or  \emph{sensed}) actively (e.g., in cancer diagnosis each patient might  go through many tests such as CT, Ultrasound and MRI to get valuable  features). The strength of this model is that one actively sensed  (sample, view) pair would improve the \emph{joint} multi-view  classification on all the samples. For this purpose we extend the  Bayesian co-training framework such that it can handle missing views  in a principled way, and introduce two criteria for view acquisition.  Experiments on one toy data and two real-world medical problems show  the effectiveness of this model.},
