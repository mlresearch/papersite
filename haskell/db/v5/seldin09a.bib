  abstract = {We derive a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for density estimation.  Similar to the PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for classification, the  result has the appealingly simple form of a tradeoff between empirical  performance and the KL-divergence of the posterior from the  prior. Moreover, the PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for  classification can be derived as a special case of the bound for density  estimation.    To illustrate a possible application of our bound we derive a  generalization bound for co-clustering. The bound provides a criterion  to evaluate the ability of co-clustering to predict new co-occurrences,  thus introducing a supervised flavor to this traditionally unsupervised task.},
