  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to investigate the  properties of partitioning scoring rules in the  bipartite ranking setup. We focus on ranking  rules based on scoring functions. General suf-  cient conditions for the AUC consistency of  scoring functions that are constant on cells  of a partition of the feature space are provided.  Rate bounds are obtained for cubic  histogram scoring rules under mild smoothness  assumptions on the regression function.  In this setup, it is shown how to penalize the  empirical AUC criterion in order to select a  scoring rule nearly as good as the one that  can be built when the degree of smoothness  of the regression function is known.},
