  abstract = {We study the problem of learning the topology of an undirected network  by observing a random subsample.  Specifically, the sample is chosen by  randomly selecting a fixed number of vertices, and for each we are allowed  to observe all edges it is incident with.  We analyze a general formalization  of learning from such samples, and derive confidence bounds on the number  of differences between the true and learned topologies, as a function of  the number of observed mistakes and the algorithm's bias.  In addition to this  general analysis, we also analyze a variant of the problem under a stochastic  block model assumption.},
