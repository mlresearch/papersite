  abstract = {The problem of extracting features from given data is of critical
importance for successful application of machine learning. Feature
extraction, as usually understood, seeks an optimal transformation
from input data into a (typically real-valued) feature vector that can be used as an input for a learning algorithm. Over time, this problem has
been attacked using a growing number of diverse techniques that
originated in separate research communities, including feature
selection, dimensionality reduction, manifold learning, distance
metric learning and representation learning. The goal of this paper is
to contrast and compare feature extraction techniques coming from
different machine learning areas, discuss the modern challenges and
open problems in feature extraction and suggest novel solutions to
some of them.},
