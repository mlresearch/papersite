  abstract = {In this work we present a novel approach to predict the function of proteins in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks.  We classify existing approaches into inductive and transductive approaches, and into local and global approaches.  As of yet, among the group of inductive approaches, only local ones have been proposed for protein function prediction.  We here introduce a protein description formalism that also includes global information, namely information that locates a protein relative to specific important proteins in the network.  We analyze the effect on function prediction accuracy of selecting a different number of important proteins.  With around 70 important proteins, even in large graphs, our method makes good and stable predictions.  Furthermore, we investigate whether our method also classifies proteins accurately on more detailed function levels. We examined up to five different function levels.  The method is benchmarked on four datasets where we found classification performance according to F-measure values indeed improves by 9 percent over the benchmark methods employed.},
