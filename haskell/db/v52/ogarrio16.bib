  abstract = {Existing score-based causal model search algorithms such as \textit{GES} (and a speeded up version, \textit{FGS}) are asymptotically correct, fast, and reliable, but make the unrealistic assumption that the true causal graph does not contain any unmeasured confounders. There are several constraint-based causal search algorithms (e.g \textit{RFCI}, \emph{FCI}, or \emph{FCI+}) that are asymptotically correct without assuming that there are no unmeasured confounders, but often perform poorly on small samples. We describe a combined score and constraint-based algorithm, \emph{GFCI}, that we prove is asymptotically correct. On synthetic data, \textit{GFCI} is only slightly slower than \emph{RFCI} but more accurate than \textit{FCI}, \textit{RFCI} and \textit{FCI+}.},
