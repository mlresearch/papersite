  abstract = {\emph{Directed separation} (d-separation) played a fundamental role in the founding of \emph{Bayesian networks} (BNs) and continues to be useful today in a wide range of applications. Given an independence to be tested, current implementations of d-separation explore the \emph{active} part of a BN. On the other hand, an overlooked property of d-separation implies that d-separation need only consider the \emph{relevant} part of a BN. We propose a new method for testing independencies in BNs, called \emph{relevant path separation} (rp-separation), which explores the intersection between the active and relevant parts of a BN. Favourable experimental results are reported.},
