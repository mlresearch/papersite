  title = {An example distribution for probabilistic query learning of simple deterministic languages},
  pages = {182-192},
  abstract = {In this paper, we show a special example distribution on which the learner
can guess a correct simple deterministic grammar in polynomial time from
membership queries and random examples.
At first, we show a learning algorithm of simple deterministic languages
from membership and equivalence queries.
This algorithm is not a polynomial time algorithm but, assuming a special
example distribution, we can modify it to the polynomial time
probabilistic learning algorithm.},
