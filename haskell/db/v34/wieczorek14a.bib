  abstract = {In this paper a~new algorithm for the induction of a~Directed Acyclic Word Graph
(DAWG) is proposed.  A~DAWG can serve as a~very efficient data structure for
lexicon representation and fast string matching, and have a~variety of applications.
Similar structures are being investigated in the theory of formal languages and grammatical
inference, namely deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata (DFA and NFA, respectively).
Since a~DAWG is acyclic the proposed method is suited for problems where
the target language does not necessarily have to be infinite.
The experiments have been performed for a~dataset from the domain of bioinformatics,
and our results are compared with those obtained using the current state-of-the-art
methods in heuristic DFA induction.},
