  abstract = {In applications where abstract models of reactive systems are to be
inferred, one important challenge is that the behavior of such systems
can be inherently nondeterministic.
To cope with this challenge, we developed an algorithm to infer
nondeterministic computation models in the form of Mealy machines. 
We introduce our approach and provide extensive experimental results
to assess its potential in the identification of black-box reactive
systems. The experiments involve both artificially-generated abstract
Mealy machines, and the identification of a TFTP server model starting
from a publicly-available implementation.  },
