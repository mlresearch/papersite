  abstract = {Spectral methods propose new and elegant solutions in
  probabilistic grammatical inference. We propose two ways to improve
  them. We show how a linear representation, or equivalently a weighted automata, output by the
spectral learning algorithm can be taken as an initial
point for the Baum Welch algorithm, in order to increase the
likelihood of the observation data. Secondly, we show how the
inference problem can naturally be expressed in the framework of
Structured Low-Rank Approximation. Both ideas are tested on a
benchmark extracted from the PAutomaC challenge.},
