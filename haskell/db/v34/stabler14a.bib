  abstract = {Recent computational, mathematical work on learnability extends to
classes of languages that plausibly include the human languages, but
there is nevertheless a gulf between this work and linguistic
theory. The languages of the two fields seem almost completely
disjoint and incommensurable. This paper shows that this has
happened, at least in part, because the recent advances in
learnability have been misdescribed in two important respects. First,
they have been described as resting on `empiricist' conceptions of
language, when actually, in fundamental respects that are made precise
here, they are equally compatible with the `rationalist', `nativist'
traditions in linguistic theory. Second, the recent mathematical
proposals have sometimes been presented as if they not only advance
but complete the account of human language acquisition, taking the
rather dramatic difference between what current mathematical models
can achieve and what current linguistic theories tell us as an
indication that current linguistic theories are quite generally
mistaken. This paper compares the two perspectives and takes some
first steps toward a unified theory, aiming to identify some common ground
where `rationalist' linguistic hypotheses 
could directly address weaknesses in the current mathematical proposals.},
