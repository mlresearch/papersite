  abstract = {The Causality Workbench project is an environment to test causal discovery algorithms. Via a web portal http://clopinet.com/causality, it provides a number of resources, including a repository of datasets, models, and software packages, and a virtual laboratory allowing users to benchmark causal discovery algorithms by performing virtual experiments to study artificial causal systems. We regularly organize competitions. In this paper, we describe what the platform offers for the analysis of causality in time series analysis.},
