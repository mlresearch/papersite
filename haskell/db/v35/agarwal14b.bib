  abstract = {We study decision making when each action is described by a set of
objectives, all of which are to be maximized. During the training
phase, we have access to the actions of an outside agent
(``mentor''). In the test phase, our goal is to maximally improve upon
the mentor's (unobserved) actions across all objectives. We present an
algorithm with a vanishing regret compared with the optimal possible
improvement, and show that our regret bound is the best possible. The
bound is independent of the number of actions, and scales only as the
logarithm of the number of objectives.},
