  abstract = {We give the first algorithm for Matrix Completion that achieves running time
and sample complexity that is polynomial in the rank of the unknown target
matrix, \emph{linear} in the dimension of the matrix, and \emph{logarithmic} in
the condition number of the matrix.  To the best of our knowledge, all previous
algorithms either incurred a quadratic dependence on the condition number of
the unknown matrix or a quadratic dependence on the dimension of the matrix.
Our algorithm is based on a novel extension of Alternating Minimization which
we show has theoretical guarantees under standard assumptions even in the
presence of noise.
