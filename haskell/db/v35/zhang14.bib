  abstract = {Under a standard assumption in complexity theory (NP not in P/poly),
we demonstrate a gap between the minimax prediction risk for
sparse linear regression that can be achieved by polynomial-time
algorithms, and that achieved by optimal algorithms.  In particular,
when the design matrix is ill-conditioned, the minimax prediction loss
achievable by polynomial-time algorithms can be substantially greater
than that of an optimal algorithm.  This result is the first known gap
between polynomial and optimal algorithms for sparse linear
regression, and does not depend on conjectures in average-case
complexity.},
