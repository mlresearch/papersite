  abstract = {Properties of distributions are real-valued
				functionals such as the mean, quantile or
				conditional value at risk. A property is
				elicitable if there exists a  scoring
				function such that minimization of the
				associated risks recovers the property.
				We extend existing results to characterize
				the elicitability of properties in a general
				setting. We further relate elicitability to
				identifiability (a notion introduced by Osband)
				and provide a general formula describing all
				scoring functions for an elicitable
				property. Finally, we draw some connections
				to the theory of coherent risk measures.},
