  abstract = {A/B testing refers to the task of determining the best option among two
  alternatives that yield random outcomes. We provide
  distribution-dependent lower bounds for the performance of A/B
  testing that improve over the results currently available both in the
  fixed-confidence (or $\delta$-PAC) and fixed-budget settings. When the distribution of the outcomes
  are Gaussian, we prove that the complexity of the fixed-confidence and
  fixed-budget settings are equivalent, and that uniform sampling of both
  alternatives is optimal only in the case of equal variances. In the common
  variance case, we also provide a stopping rule that terminates faster than
  existing fixed-confidence algorithms. In the case of Bernoulli distributions,
  we show that the complexity of fixed-budget setting is smaller than that
  of fixed-confidence setting and that uniform sampling of both
  alternatives---though not optimal---is advisable in practice when combined
  with an appropriate stopping criterion.},
