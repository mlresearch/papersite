  abstract = {We present a new optimization-theoretic approach to analyzing Follow-the-Leader style algorithms, particularly in the setting where perturbations are used as a tool for regularization. We show that adding a strongly convex penalty function to the decision rule and adding stochastic perturbations to data correspond to deterministic and stochastic smoothing operations, respectively. We establish an equivalence between ``Follow the Regularized Leader'' and ``Follow the Perturbed Leader'' up to the smoothness properties. This intuition leads to a new generic analysis framework that recovers and improves the previous known regret bounds of the class of algorithms commonly known as Follow the Perturbed Leader.},
