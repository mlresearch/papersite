  abstract = {Ordinal embedding refers to the following problem: all we know about an unknown set of 	 		points $x_1,\ldots, x_n \in \mathbb{R}^d$ are ordinal constraints of the form $\|x_i -
 		x_j\| < \|x_k - x_l\|$; the task is to construct a realization
 		$y_1,\ldots, y_n \in \mathbb{R}^d$ that preserves these ordinal
 		constraints. It has been conjectured since the 1960ies that upon knowledge of all ordinal
 		constraints a large but finite set of points can be approximately reconstructed up to a
 		similarity transformation. The main result of our paper is a formal
 		proof of this conjecture.},
