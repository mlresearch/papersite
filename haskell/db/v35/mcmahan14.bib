  abstract = {We study algorithms for online linear optimization in Hilbert
  spaces, focusing on the case where the player is unconstrained.  We
  develop a novel characterization of a large class of minimax
  algorithms, recovering, and even improving, several previous results
  as immediate corollaries.  Moreover, using our tools, we develop an
  algorithm that provides a regret bound of $O(U \sqrt{T \log( U
    \sqrt{T} \log^2 T +1)})$, where $U$ is the $L_2$ norm of an arbitrary
  comparator and both $T$ and $U$ are unknown to the player. This
  bound is optimal up to $\sqrt{\log \log T}$ terms.  When $T$ is
  known, we derive an algorithm with an optimal regret bound (up to
  constant factors).  For both the known and unknown $T$ case, a Normal
  approximation to the conditional value of the game proves to be the
  key analysis tool.},
