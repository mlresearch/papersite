  abstract = {We develop fast algorithms for solving regression problems on graphs
where one is given the value of a function at some vertices, and
must find its smoothest possible extension to all vertices.
The extension we compute is the absolutely minimal
Lipschitz extension, and is the limit for large $p$ of $p$-Laplacian
regularization.
We present an algorithm that computes a minimal Lipschitz extension
in expected linear time, and an algorithm that computes an absolutely
minimal Lipschitz extension in expected time $\widetilde{O} (m n)$.
The latter algorithm has variants that seem to run much faster in practice.
These
extensions are particularly amenable to regularization: we can
perform $l_{0}$-regularization on the given values in polynomial
time and $l_{1}$-regularization on the initial function values and on graph edge weights in time
$\widetilde{O} (m^{3/2})$.

Our definitions and algorithms naturally extend to
directed graphs.},
