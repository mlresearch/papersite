  abstract = {We show an essentially tight bound on the number of adaptively chosen statistical queries that a computationally efficient algorithm can answer accurately given $n$ samples from an unknown distribution.  A statistical query asks for the expectation of a predicate over the underlying distribution, and an answer to a statistical query is accurate if it is ``close'' to the correct expectation over the distribution.  This question was recently studied by Dwork et al. (2015), who showed how to answer $\tilde{\Omega}(n^2)$ queries efficiently, and also by Hardt and Ulman (2014), who showed that answering $\tilde{O}(n^3)$ queries is hard.  We close the gap between the two bounds and show that, under a standard hardness assumption, there is no computationally efficient algorithm that, given $n$ samples from an unknown distribution, can give valid answers to $O(n^2)$ adaptively chosen statistical queries.  An implication of our results is that computationally efficient algorithms for answering arbitrary, adaptively chosen statistical queries may as well be \emph{differentially private}.

We obtain our results using a new connection between the problem of answering adaptively chosen statistical queries and a combinatorial object called an \emph{interactive fingerprinting code} Fiat and Tassa (2001).  In order to optimize our hardness result, we give a new Fourier-analytic approach to analyzing fingerprinting codes that is simpler, more flexible, and yields better parameters than previous constructions.},
