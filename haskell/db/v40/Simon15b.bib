  abstract = {The Recursive Teaching Dimension (RTD) of a concept
class $\mathcal{C}$ is a complexity parameter referring to the
worst-case number of labelled examples needed to learn any target
concept in $\mathcal{C}$ from a teacher following the recursive
teaching model. It is the first teaching complexity notion for
which interesting relationships to the VC dimension (VCD) have
been established. In particular, for finite maximum classes of
a given VCD $d$, the RTD equals $d$. To date, there is no concept
class known for which the ratio of RTD over VCD exceeds $3/2$.
However, the only known upper bound on RTD in terms of VCD is
exponential in the VCD and depends on the size of the concept
class. We pose the following question: is the RTD upper-bounded
by a function that grows only linearly in the VCD?
Answering this question would further our understanding of the
relationships between the complexity of teaching and the complexity
of learning from randomly chosen examples. In addition, the answer
to this question, whether positive or negative, is known to have
implications on the study of the long-standing open sample
compression conjecture, which claims that every concept class
of VCD $d$ has a sample compression scheme in which samples for
concepts in the class are compressed to subsets of size no larger
than $d$.},
