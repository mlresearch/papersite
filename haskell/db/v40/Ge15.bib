  abstract = {We analyze stochastic gradient descent for optimizing non-convex functions. In many cases for non-convex functions the goal is to find a reasonable local minimum, and the main concern is that gradient updates are trapped in {\em saddle points}. In this paper we identify {\em strict saddle} property for non-convex problem that allows for efficient optimization. Using this property we show that from an {\em arbitrary} starting point,  stochastic gradient descent converges to a local minimum in a polynomial number of iterations. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work that gives {\em global} convergence guarantees for stochastic gradient descent on non-convex functions with exponentially many local minima and saddle points.

Our analysis can be applied to orthogonal tensor decomposition, which is widely used in learning a rich class of  latent variable models. We propose a new optimization formulation for the tensor decomposition problem that has strict saddle property. As a result we get the first online algorithm for orthogonal tensor decomposition with global convergence guarantee.},
