  abstract = {Given a large data matrix $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$, we consider the problem of determining
whether its entries are i.i.d. from some known marginal distribution
$A_{ij}\sim P_0$,
or instead $A$ contains a principal submatrix $A_{{\sf Q},{\sf Q}}$ whose entries
have marginal distribution $A_{ij}\sim P_1\neq P_0$. As a special
case, the hidden (or planted) clique problem is finding a planted
clique in an otherwise uniformly random graph.

Assuming unbounded computational resources, this hypothesis testing
problem is statistically solvable  provided $|{\sf Q}|\ge C \log n$
for a suitable constant $C$. However, despite substantial effort, no
polynomial time algorithm is known that succeeds with high probability
when $|{\sf Q}| = o(\sqrt{n})$.  Recently,
\cite{meka2013association} proposed a method to establish lower bounds
for the hidden clique problem
within the Sum of Squares (SOS)
semidefinite hierarchy.

Here we consider the degree-$4$ SOS relaxation, and study the
construction of \cite{meka2013association} to prove that SOS
fails unless $k\ge C\, n^{1/3}/\log n$.
An argument presented by \cite{BarakLectureNotes}
implies that this lower bound cannot be substantially  improved unless  the witness
construction is changed in the proof. Our proof uses the moment method
to bound the spectrum of a certain random association scheme, i.e.
a symmetric random matrix whose rows and columns are indexed by the
edges of an Erd\"os-Renyi random graph.
