  abstract = {First-order convex minimization algorithms are currently the methods of choice for
large-scale sparse -- and more generally parsimonious -- regression models.
We pose the question on the limits of performance of black-box
oriented methods for convex minimization in {\em non-standard settings},
where the regularity of the objective is measured in a norm not necessarily
induced by the feasible domain. This question is studied for
$\ell_p/\ell_q$-settings, and their matrix analogues (Schatten norms), where
we find surprising gaps on lower bounds compared to state of the art methods.
We propose a conjecture on the optimal convergence rates for these settings,
for which a positive answer would lead to significant improvements on minimization
algorithms for parsimonious regression models.},
