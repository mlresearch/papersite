  abstract = {In this work
we study the widely used \emph{spectral clustering} algorithms, i.e.
partition a graph into $k$ clusters via (1) embedding the vertices of a graph into a low-dimensional space using the bottom eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix, and (2) partitioning embedded points via $k$-means algorithms.  We show that, for a wide class of \emph{well-clustered graphs},
spectral clustering algorithms can give a good approximation of the optimal clustering. To the best of our knowledge, it is the \emph{first} theoretical analysis of spectral clustering algorithms for a wide family of graphs, even though such approach was proposed in the early 1990s and has
comprehensive applications.

We also give a nearly-linear time algorithm for partitioning well-clustered graphs, which is based on
heat kernel embeddings and
approximate nearest neighbor data structures.},
