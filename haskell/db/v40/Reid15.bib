  abstract = {Mixability is a property of a loss which characterizes when constant regret is possible in the game of prediction with expert advice. We show that a key property of mixability generalizes, and the $\exp$ and $\log$ operations present in the usual theory are not as special as one might have thought.  In doing so we introduce a more general notion of $\Phi$-mixability where $\Phi$ is a general entropy (\emph{i.e.}, any convex function on probabilities). We show how a property shared by the convex dual of any such entropy yields a natural algorithm (the minimizer of a regret bound) which, analogous to the classical Aggregating Algorithm, is guaranteed a constant regret when used with $\Phi$-mixable losses.  We characterize which $\Phi$ have non-trivial $\Phi$-mixable losses and relate $\Phi$-mixability and its associated Aggregating Algorithm to potential-based methods, a Blackwell-like condition, mirror descent, and risk measures from finance.  We also define a notion of ``dominance'' between different entropies in terms of bounds they guarantee and conjecture that classical mixability gives optimal bounds, for which we provide some supporting empirical evidence.},
