  abstract = {There has been considerable recent interest in
distribution-tests whose run-time and
sample requirements are sublinear in the domain-size $k$.
We study two of the most important tests under the
conditional-sampling model where each query
specifies a subset $S$ of the domain, and the
response is a sample drawn from $S$ according
to the underlying distribution.

For identity testing, which asks whether the
underlying distribution equals a specific given
distribution or $\epsilon$-differs from it,
we reduce the known time and sample complexities
from $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-4})$ to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$,
thereby matching the information theoretic lower bound.
For closeness testing, which asks whether two
distributions underlying observed data sets are
equal or different, we reduce existing complexity
from $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-4} \log^5 k)$ to an even
sub-logarithmic $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-5} \log \log k)$ thus
providing a better bound to
an open problem in Bertinoro Workshop on Sublinear Algorithms (Fisher, $2014$).},
