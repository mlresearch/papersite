  abstract = {We establish a minimax lower bound of $\Omega(\frac{kd}{B\epsilon})$ on
the sample size needed to estimate parameters in a $k$-sparse linear
regression of dimension $d$ under memory restrictions to
$B$ bits, where $\epsilon$ is the $\ell_2$ parameter error.  When the
covariance of the regressors is the identity matrix, we also provide an
algorithm that uses $\tilde{O}(B+k)$ bits and requires
$\tilde{O}(\frac{kd}{B\epsilon^2})$ observations to achieve error $\epsilon$.
Our lower bound also holds in the more general
communication-bounded setting, where instead of a memory bound, at
most $B$ bits of information are allowed to be (adaptively)
communicated about each sample.
