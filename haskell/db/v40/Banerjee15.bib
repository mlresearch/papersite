  abstract = {The restricted eigenvalue (RE) condition characterizes the sample complexity of accurate recovery in the
context of high-dimensional estimators such as Lasso and Dantzig selector (Bickel et al., 2009). Recent work
has shown that random design matrices drawn from any thin-tailed (sub-Gaussian) distributions satisfy the
RE condition with high probability, when the number of samples scale as the square of the Gaussian width
of the restricted set (Banerjee et al., 2014; Tropp, 2015). We pose the equivalent question for heavy-tailed
distributions: Given a random design matrix drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution satisfying the smallball
property (Mendelson, 2015), does the design matrix satisfy the RE condition with the same order of
sample complexity as sub-Gaussian distributions? An answer to the question will guide the design of highdimensional
estimators for heavy tailed problems.},
