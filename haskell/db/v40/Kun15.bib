  abstract = {We pose an open problem on the complexity of learning the behavior of a quantum circuit with value injection queries. We define the learning model for quantum circuits and give preliminary results. Using the test-path lemma of Angluin et al. (2009a), we show that new ideas are likely needed to tackle value injection queries for the quantum setting.},
