  abstract = {We propose a method to aggregate noisy ordinal labels collected from a crowd of workers or annotators.  Eliciting ordinal labels is important in tasks such as judging web search quality and consumer satisfaction. Our method is  motivated by the observation that workers usually have difficulty distinguishing between two adjacent ordinal classes whereas distinguishing between two classes which are far away from each other is much easier. We develop the method  through  minimax conditional entropy subject to constraints which encode this observation. Empirical  evaluations on real datasets demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods.},
