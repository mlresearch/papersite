  abstract = {Despite widespread interest and practical use, the theoretical properties of random forests are still not well understood. In this paper we contribute to this understanding in two ways. We present a new theoreti- cally tractable variant of random regression forests and prove that our algorithm is con- sistent. We also provide an empirical eval- uation, comparing our algorithm and other theoretically tractable random forest models to the random forest algorithm used in prac- tice. Our experiments provide insight into the relative importance of different simplifi- cations that theoreticians have made to ob- tain tractable models for analysis.},
