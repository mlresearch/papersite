  abstract = {We describe a deterministic anytime method for calculating  filtered and smoothed distributions in large variable-based continuous time  Markov processes.  Prior non-random algorithms do not converge to the true  distribution in the limit of infinite computation time.  Sampling  algorithms give different results each time run, which can lead to  instability when used inside expectation-maximization or other algorithms.  Our method combines the anytime convergent properties of sampling with the  non-random nature of variational approaches.  It is built upon a sum of  time-ordered products, an expansion of the matrix exponential.  We  demonstrate that our method performs as well as or better than the current  best sampling approaches on benchmark problems.},
