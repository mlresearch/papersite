  abstract = {Exchangeable graph models (ExGM) subsume a number of popular network models. The mathematical object that characterizes an ExGM is  termed a graphon. Finding scalable estimators of graphons, provably consistent, remains an open issue. In this paper, we propose a histogram estimator of a graphon that is provably consistent and numerically efficient. The proposed estimator is based on a sorting-and-smoothing (SAS) algorithm, which first sorts the empirical degree of a graph, then smooths the sorted graph using total variation minimization. The consistency of the SAS algorithm is proved by leveraging  sparsity concepts from compressed sensing.},
