  abstract = {Pooling operators construct non-linear representations  by cascading a redundant linear transform, followed by   a point-wise nonlinearity and a local aggregation, typically  implemented with a $\ell_p$ norm.   Their efficiency in recognition architectures is based   on their ability to locally contract the input space,   but also on their capacity to retain as much stable information   as possible.  We address this latter question by computing the upper and   lower Lipschitz bounds of $\ell_p$ pooling operators for $p=1, 2, \infty$  as well as their half-rectified equivalents, which give  sufficient conditions for the design of invertible pooling layers.  Numerical experiments on MNIST and image patches confirm that  pooling layers can be inverted with phase recovery algorithms. Moreover,  the regularity of the inverse pooling, controlled by the lower Lipschitz constant,   is empirically verified with a nearest neighbor regression.},
