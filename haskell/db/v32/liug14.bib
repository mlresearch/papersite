  abstract = {In the Superset Label Learning (SLL) problem, weak supervision is  provided in the form of a {\it superset} of labels that contains the  true label.  If the classifier predicts a label outside of the  superset, it commits a {\it superset error}.  Most existing SLL  algorithms learn a multiclass classifier by minimizing the superset  error. However, only limited theoretical analysis has been dedicated  to this approach. In this paper, we analyze Empirical Risk Minimizing  learners that use the superset error as the empirical risk measure.  SLL data can arise either in the form of independent instances or as  multiple-instance bags. For both scenarios, we give the conditions for  ERM learnability and sample complexity for the realizable case.},
