  abstract = {We present a new algorithm for the contextual bandit learning problem,  where the learner repeatedly takes one of $K$ \emph{actions} in response to the  observed \emph{context}, and observes the \emph{reward} only for that  action. Our method assumes access to an oracle for solving fully  supervised cost-sensitive classification problems and achieves the  statistically optimal regret guarantee with only $\otil(\sqrt{KT})$  oracle calls across all $T$ rounds. By doing so, we obtain the most  practical contextual bandit learning algorithm amongst approaches that  work for general policy classes.  We conduct a  proof-of-concept experiment which demonstrates the excellent  computational and statistical performance of (an online variant of) our  algorithm relative to several strong baselines.},
