  abstract = {Recent work in method of moments provide consistent estimates for  latent-variable models, avoiding local optima issues, but these methods can  only be applied to certain types of graphical models. In this work, we show  that the method of moments in conjunction with a composite marginal likelihood  objective yields consistent parameter estimates for a much broader class of  directed and undirected graphical models, including loopy graphs with high  treewidth. Specifically, we use tensor factorization to reveal partial  information about the hidden variables, rendering the otherwise non-convex  negative log-likelihood convex. Our approach gracefully extends to models  outside our class by incorporating the partial information via posterior  regulraization.},
