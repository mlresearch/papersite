  abstract = {We present a series of learning algorithms and theoretical guarantees for designing accurate ensembles of structured prediction tasks. This includes several randomized and deterministic algorithms devised by converting on-line learning algorithms to batch ones, and a boosting-style algorithm applicable in the context of structured prediction with a large number of labels. We give a detailed study of all these algorithms, including the description of new on-line-to-batch conversions and learning guarantees. We also report the results of extensive experiments with these algorithms in several structured prediction tasks.},
