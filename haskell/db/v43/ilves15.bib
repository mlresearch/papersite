  abstract = {We present our ongoing work on an interactive exploratory information retrieval system designed to explain to the user the reasons for its predictions and help the user to build a mental model to predict how the system will behave. Users indicate which documents interest them and reinforcement learning is used to model the user by allowing the system to trade off between exploration and exploitation.},
