  title = {Ordinal Random Fields for Recommender Systems},
  pages = {283-298},
  abstract = {Recommender Systems heavily rely on numerical preferences, whereas
	the importance of ordinal preferences has only been recognised in
	recent works of Ordinal Matrix Factorisation (OMF). Although the
	OMF can effectively exploit ordinal properties, it captures only
	the higher-order interactions among users and items, without considering
	the localised interactions properly. This paper employs Markov Random
	Fields (MRF) to investigate the localised interactions, and proposes
	a unified model called Ordinal Random Fields (ORF) to take advantages
	of both the representational power of the MRF and the ease of modelling
	ordinal preferences by the OMF. Experimental result on public datasets
	demonstrates that the proposed ORF model can capture both types of
	interactions, resulting in improved recommendation accuracy.},
