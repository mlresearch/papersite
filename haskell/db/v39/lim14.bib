  abstract = {Bibliographic analysis considers author's research areas, the citation
	network and paper content among other things. In this paper, we combine
	these three in a topic model that produces a bibliographic model
	of authors, topics and documents using a non-parametric extension
	of a combination of the Poisson mixed-topic link model and the author-topic
	model. We propose a novel and efficient inference algorithm for the
	model to explore subsets of research publications from CiteSeerX.
	Our model demonstrates improved performance in both model fitting
	and clustering task comparing to several baselines.},
