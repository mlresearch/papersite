  abstract = {Dimensionality reduction is a fundamental problem of machine learning,
	and has been intensively studied, where classification and clustering
	are two special cases of dimensionality reduction that reduce high-dimensional
	data to discrete points. Here we describe a simple multilayer network
	for dimensionality reduction that each layer of the network is a
	group of mutually independent k-centers clusterings. We find that
	the network can be trained successfully layer-by-layer by simply
	assigning the centers of each clustering by randomly sampled data
	points from the input. Our results show that the described simple
	method outperformed 7 well-known dimensionality reduction methods
	on both very small-scale biomedical data and large-scale image and
	document data, with less training time than multilayer neural networks
	on large-scale data.},
