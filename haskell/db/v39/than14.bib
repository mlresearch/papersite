  abstract = {Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) provides an efficient tool to analyze
	very large text collections. In this paper, we discuss three novel
	contributions: (1) a proof for the tractability of the MAP estimation
	of topic mixtures under certain conditions that might fit well with
	practices, even though the problem is known to be intractable in
	the worst case; (2) a provably fast algorithm (OFW) for inferring
	topic mixtures; (3) a dual online algorithm (DOLDA) for learning
	LDA at a large scale. We show that OFW converges to some local optima,
	but under certain conditions it can converge to global optima. The
	discussion of OFW is very general and hence can be readily employed
	to accelerate the MAP estimation in a wide class of probabilistic
	models. From extensive experiments we find that DOLDA can achieve
	significantly better predictive performance and more interpretable
	topics, with lower runtime, than stochastic variational inference.
	Further, DOLDA enables us to easily analyze text streams or millions
	of documents.},
