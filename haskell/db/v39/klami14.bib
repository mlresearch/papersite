  abstract = {Bayesian inference for latent factor models, such as principal component
	and canonical correlation analysis, is easy for Gaussian likelihoods.
	In particular, full conjugacy makes both Gibbs samplers and mean-field
	variational approximations straightforward. For other likelihood
	potentials one needs to either resort to more complex sampling schemes
	or to specifying dedicated forms of variational lower bounds. Recently,
	however, it was shown that for specific likelihoods related to the
	logistic function it is possible to augment the joint density with
	auxiliary variables following a Polya-Gamma distribution, leading
	to closed-form updates for binary and over-dispersed count models.
	In this paper we describe how Gibbs sampling and mean-field variational
	approximation for various latent factor models can be implemented
	for these cases, presenting easy-to-implement and efficient inference
	schemas.},
