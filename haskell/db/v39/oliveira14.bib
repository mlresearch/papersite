  abstract = {This paper describes a new type of ensembles that aims at improving
	the predictive performance of these approaches in time series forecasting.
	Ensembles are recognised as one of the most successful approaches
	to prediction tasks. Previous theoretical studies of ensembles have
	shown that one of the key reasons for this performance is diversity
	among ensemble members. Several methods exist to generate diversity.
	The key idea of the work we are presenting here is to propose a new
	form of diversity generation that explores some specific properties
	of time series prediction tasks. Our hypothesis is that the resulting
	ensemble members will be better at addressing different dynamic regimes
	of time series data. Our large set of experiments confirms that the
	methods we have explored for generating diversity are able to improve
	the performance of the equivalent ensembles with standard diversity
	generation procedures.},
