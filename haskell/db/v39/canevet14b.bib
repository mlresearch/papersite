  abstract = {We propose a novel approach to efficiently select informative samples
	for large-scale learning. Instead of directly feeding a learning
	algorithm with a very large amount of samples, as it is usually done
	to reach state-of-the-art performance, we have developed a "distillation"
	procedure to recursively reduce the size of an initial training set
	using a criterion that ensures the maximization of the information
	content of the selected sub-set. We demonstrate the performance of
	this procedure for two different computer vision problems. First,
	we show that distillation can be used to improve the traditional
	bootstrapping approach to object detection. Second, we apply distillation
	to a classification problem with artificial distortions. We show
	that in both cases, using the result of a distillation process instead
	of a random sub-set taken uniformly in the original sample set improves
	performance significantly.},
