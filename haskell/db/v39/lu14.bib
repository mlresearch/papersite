  abstract = {We investigate online active learning techniques for classification
	tasks in data stream mining applications. Unlike traditional learning
	approaches (either batch or online learning) that often require to
	request class label of each incoming instance, online active learning
	queries only a subset of informative incoming instances to update
	the classification model, which aims to maximize the classification
	performance using the minimal human labeling effort during the entire
	online stream data mining tasks. In this paper, we present a new
	family of algorithms for online active learning called Passive-Aggressive
	Active (PAA) learning algorithms by adapting the popular Passive-Aggressive
	algorithms in an online active learning setting. Unlike the conventional
	Perceptron-based approach that employs only the misclassified instances
	for updating the model, the proposed PAA learning algorithms not
	only use the misclassified instances to update the classifier, but
	also exploit those correctly classified examples yet with low prediction
	confidence. We theoretically analyze the mistakes bounds of the proposed
	algorithms and conduct extensive experiments to examine their empirical
	performance, in which the encouraging results show clear advantages
	of our algorithms over the baselines.},
