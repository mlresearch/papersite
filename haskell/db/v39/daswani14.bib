  abstract = {The problem we consider in this paper is reinforcement learning with
	value advice. In this setting, the agent is given limited access
	to an oracle that can tell it the expected return (value) of any
	state-action pair with respect to the optimal policy. The agent must
	use this value to learn an explicit policy that performs well in
	the environment. We provide an algorithm called RLAdvice, based on
	the imitation learning algorithm DAgger. We illustrate the effectiveness
	of this method in the Arcade Learning Environment on three different
	games, using value estimates from UCT as advice.},
