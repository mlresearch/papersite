  abstract = {For the last few decades, a combination of different learning machines
	so-called ensemble learning, including learning with multiple kernels,
	has attracted much attention in the field of machine learning. Although
	its efficacy was revealed numerically in many works, its theoretical
	grounds are not investigated sufficiently. In this paper, we discuss
	regression problems with a class of kernels whose corresponding reproducing
	kernel Hilbert spaces have a common subspace with an invariant metric
	and prove that the ensemble kernel regressor (the mean of kernel
	regressors with those kernels) gives a better learning result than
	the multiple kernel regressor (the kernel regressor with the sum
	of those kernels) in terms of the generalization ability of a model
	space.},
