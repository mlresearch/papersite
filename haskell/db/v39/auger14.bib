  abstract = {Solving zero-sum matrix games is polynomial, because it boils down
	to linear programming. The approximate solving is sublinear by randomized
	algorithms on machines with random access memory. Algorithms working
	separately and independently on columns and rows have been proposed,
	with the same performance; these versions are compliant with matrix
	games with stochastic reward. [1] has proposed a new version, empirically
	performing better on sparse problems, i.e. cases in which the Nash
	equilibrium has small support. In this paper, we propose a variant,
	similar to their work, also dedicated to sparse problems, with provably
	better bounds than existing methods. We then experiment the method
	on a card game.},
