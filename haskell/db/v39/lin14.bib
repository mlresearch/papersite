	Binary Classification},
  pages = {371-386},
  abstract = {Many real-world applications require varying costs for different types
	of mis-classification errors. Such a cost-sensitive classification
	setup can be very different from the regular classification one,
	especially in the multiclass case. Thus, traditional meta-algorithms
	for regular multiclass classification, such as the popular one-versus-one
	approach, may not always work well under the cost-sensitive classification
	setup. In this paper, we extend the one-versus-one approach to the
	field of cost-sensitive classification. The extension is derived
	using a rigorous mathematical tool called the cost-transformation
	technique, and takes the original one-versus-one as a special case.
	Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve
	better performance in many cost-sensitive classification scenarios
	when compared with the original one-versus-one as well as existing
	cost-sensitive classification algorithms.},
