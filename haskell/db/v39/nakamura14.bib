  abstract = {We consider a direct mail problem in which a system repeats the following
	process every day during some period: select a set of user-item pairs
	(u,i), send a recommendation mail of item i to user u for each selected
	pair (u,i), and receive a response from each user. We assume that
	each response can be obtained before the next process and through
	the response, the system can know the user's evaluation of the recommended
	item directly or indirectly. Each pair (u,i) can be selected at most
	once during the period. If the total number of selections is very
	small compared to the number of entries in the whole user-item matrix,
	what selection strategy should be used to maximize the total sum
	of users' evaluations during the period? We consider a UCB-like strategy
	for this problem, and show two methods using the strategy. The effectiveness
	of our methods are demonstrated by experiments using synthetic and
	real datasets.},
