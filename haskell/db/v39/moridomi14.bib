  abstract = {We consider an online matrix prediction problem. The FTRL is a famous
	method to deal with online prediction task, which makes prediction
	by minimizing cumulative loss function and regularizer function.
	There are three popular regularizer functions for matrices, Frobenius
	norm, quantum relative entropy and log-determinant. We propose a
	FTRL based algorithm with log-determinant as regularizer and show
	regret bound of algorithm. Our main contribution is to show that
	log-determinant regularization is efficient when sparse loss function
	setting. We also show the optimal performance algorithm for online
	collaborative filtering problem with log-determinant regularization.},
