  abstract = {This paper proposes a new fault detection and analysis approach which
	can leverage incomplete prior information. Conventional data-driven
	approaches suffer from the problem of overfitting and result in high
	rates of false positives, and model-driven approaches suffer from
	a lack of specific information about complex systems. We overcome
	these problems by modifying the denoising autoencoder (DA), a data-driven
	method, to form a new approach, called the structured denoising autoencoder
	(SDA), which can utilize incomplete prior information. The SDA does
	not require specific information and can perform well without overfitting.
	In particular, an empirical analysis with synthetic data revealed
	that the SDA performs better than the DA even when there is partially
	incorrect or abstract information. An evaluation using real data
	from moving cars also showed that the SDA with incomplete knowledge
	outperformed conventional methods. Surprisingly, the SDA results
	were better even though the parameters of the conventional methods
	were tuned using faulty data, which are normally unknown. In addition,
	the SDA fault analysis was able to extract the true causes of the
	changes within the faulty data; the other methods were unable to
	do this. Thus, only our proposed method can explain why the faults
	occurred.},
