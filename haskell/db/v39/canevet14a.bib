  abstract = {Object detectors based on the sliding window technique are usually
	trained in two successive steps: first, an initial classifier is
	trained on a population of positive samples (i.e. images of the object
	to detect) and negative samples randomly extracted from scenes which
	do not contain the object to detect. Then, the scenes are scanned
	with that initial classifier to enrich the initial set with negative
	samples incorrectly classified as positive. This bootstrapping process
	provides the learning algorithm with "hard" samples, which help to
	improve the decision boundary. Little work has been done on how to
	efficiently enrich the training set. While the standard bootstrapping
	approach densely visits the scenes, we propose to evaluate which
	regions of scenes can be discarded without any further computation
	to concentrate the search on promising areas. We apply our method
	to two standard object detection settings, pedestrian and face detection,
	and show that it provides a multi-fold speed up.},
