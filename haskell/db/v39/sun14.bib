  pages = {16-31},
  abstract = {Sparsity in $\Re^m$ has been widely explored in machine learning.
	We study sparsity on a statistical simplex consisting of all categorical
	distributions. This is different from the case in $\Re^m$ because
	such a simplex is a Riemannian manifold, a curved space. A learner
	with sparse constraints should be likely to fall to its low-dimensional
	boundaries. We present a novel analysis on the statistical simplex
	as a manifold with boundary. The main contribution is an explicit
	view of the learning dynamics in between high-dimensional models
	in the interior of the simplex and low-dimensional models on its
	boundaries. We prove the differentiability of the cost function,
	the natural gradient with respect to the Riemannian structure, and
	convexity around the singular regions. We uncover an interesting
	relationship with $L_1$ regularization. We apply the proposed technique
	to social network analysis. Given a directed graph, the task is to
	rank a subset of influencer nodes. Here, sparsity means that the
	top-ranked nodes should present diversity in the sense of minimizing
	influence overlap. We present a ranking algorithm based on the natural
	gradient. It can scale up to graph datasets with millions of nodes.
	On real large networks, the top-ranked nodes are the most informative
	among several commonly-used techniques.},
