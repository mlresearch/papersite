  abstract = {We address a problem of learning ordinal classifier from partially
	annotated examples. We introduce an interval-insensitive loss function
	to measure discrepancy between predictions of an ordinal classifier
	and a partial annotation provided in the form of intervals of admissible
	labels. The proposed interval-insensitive loss is an instance of
	loss functions previously used for learning of different classification
	models from partially annotated examples. We propose several convex
	surrogates of the interval-insensitive loss which can be efficiently
	optimized by existing solvers. Experiments on standard benchmarks
	and a real-life application show that learning ordinal classifiers
	from partially annotated examples is competitive to the so-far used
	methods learning from the complete annotation.},
