  abstract = {Support Vector Machines (SVM) are powerful supervised learnings method in machine
	learning. However, their applicability to large problems, where frequent retraining of the
	system is required, has been limited due to the time consuming training stage whose 
	computational cost scales quadratically with the number of examples. In this work, a complete
	FPGA-based system for kernelized SVM training using ensemble learning is presented.
	The proposed framework builds on the FPGA architecture and utilises a cascaded 
	multiprecision training flow, exploits the heterogeneity within the training problem by tuning
	the number representation used, and supports ensemble training tuned to each internal
	memory structure so to address very large datasets. Its performance evaluation shows
	that the proposed system achieves more than an order of magnitude better results 
	compared to state-of-the-art CPU and GPU-based implementations, providing a stepping stone
	for researchers and practitioners to tackle large-scale SVM problems that require frequent
	retraining.},
