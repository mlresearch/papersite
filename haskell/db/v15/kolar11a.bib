  abstract = {The time-varying multivariate Gaussian distribution and the   undirected graph associated with it, as introduced in   Zhou et al. (2008), provide a useful statistical framework for   modeling complex dynamic networks. In many application domains, it   is of high importance to estimate the graph structure of the model   consistently for the purpose of scientific discovery. In this short   note, we show that under suitable technical conditions the structure   of the undirected graphical model can be consistently estimated in   the high dimensional setting, when the dimensionality of the model   is allowed to diverge with the sample size. The model selection   consistency is shown for the procedure proposed in Zhou et al. (2008)   and for the modified neighborhood selection procedure of   Meinshausen and BÃ¼hlmann (2006).
