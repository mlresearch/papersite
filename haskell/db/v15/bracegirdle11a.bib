  abstract = {Reset models are constrained switching latent Markov models in which the dynamics either continues according to a standard model, or the latent variable is resampled. We consider exact marginal inference in this class of models and their extension, the switch-reset models. A further convenient class of conjugate-exponential reset models is also discussed. For a length T time-series, exact filtering scales with T squared and smoothing T cubed. We discuss approximate filtering and smoothing routines that scale linearly with T. Applications are given to change-point models and reset linear dynamical systems.
