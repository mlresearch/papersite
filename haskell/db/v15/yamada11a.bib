  abstract = {The goal of cross-domain object matching (CDOM) is to find correspondence between two sets of objects in different domains in an unsupervised way. Photo album summarization is a typical application of CDOM, where photos are automatically aligned into a designed frame expressed in the Cartesian coordinate system. CDOM is usually formulated as finding a mapping from objects in one domain (photos) to objects in the other domain (frame) so that the pairwise dependency is maximized. A state-of-the-art CDOM method employs a kernel-based dependency measure, but it has a drawback that the kernel parameter needs to be determined manually. In this paper, we propose alternative CDOM methods that can naturally address the model selection problem.  Through experiments on image matching, unpaired voice conversion, and photo album summarization tasks, the effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated.
