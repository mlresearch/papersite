  abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of planning   in the infinite-horizon discounted-reward Markov decision problems.  We propose a novel iterative method, called dynamic policy programming (DPP), which updates the parametrized policy by a Bellman-like iteration.  For discrete state-action case, we establish  sup-norm loss bounds for the performance of the policy induced by DPP and  prove that it asymptotically converges to the optimal policy.  Then, we generalize our approach to large-scale (continuous) state-action problems using function approximation technique.   We provide  sup-norm performance-loss bounds  for approximate DPP and compare these bounds with the standard results  from  approximate dynamic programming (ADP) showing that approximate DPP results in a tighter asymptotic bound than standard ADP methods.  We also numerically compare the performance of DPP to other ADP and RL methods.  We observe that approximate DPP  asymptotically outperforms other methods on the mountain-car problem.
