  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a family of kernels for the data distributions belonging to the  exponential family. We call these kernels generative kernels because they take into account the generative process of the data. Our proposed method considers the geometry of the data distribution to build a set of efficient closed-form kernels best suited for that distribution. We compare our generative kernels on multinomial data and observe improved empirical performance across the board. Moreover, our generative kernels perform significantly better when training size is small, an important property of the generative models.
