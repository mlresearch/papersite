  abstract = {Modeling ranked data is an essential component in a number of important applications including recommendation systems and web-search. In many cases, judges omit preference among unobserved items and between unobserved and observed items. This case of analyzing incomplete   rankings is very important from a practical perspective and yet has   not been fully studied due to considerable computational   difficulties. We show how to avoid such computational difficulties   and efficiently construct a non-parametric model for rankings with   missing items. We demonstrate our approach and show how it applies in the context of collaborative filtering.
