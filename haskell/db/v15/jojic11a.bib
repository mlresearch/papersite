  abstract = {Convex envelopes of the cardinality and rank function, $l_1$ and nuclear norm, have gained immense popularity due to their sparsity inducing properties. This gave rise to   a natural approach to building objectives with sparse optima  whereby such convex penalties are added to another objective.   Such a heuristic approach to objective building does not always work. For example, addition of an $L_1$ penalty to the KL-divergence fails to induce any sparsity, as the $L_1$ norm of any vector in a simplex is a constant.   However, a convex envelope of KL and a cardinality penalty can be obtained that indeed trades off sparsity and KL-divergence.    We consider cases of two composite penalties, elastic net and fused lasso, which combine multiple desiderata.   In both of these cases, we show that a hard objective relaxed to obtain penalties can be more tightly approximated.   Further, by construction, it is impossible to get a better convex approximation than the ones we derive.     Thus, constructing a joint envelope across different parts of the objective   provides means to trade off tightness and computational cost.
