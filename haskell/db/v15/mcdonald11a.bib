  abstract = {The literature on statistical learning for time series assumes the asymptotic independence or ``"mixing"'' of the data-generating process.  These mixing assumptions are never tested, nor are there methods for estimating mixing rates from data. We give an estimator for the beta-mixing rate based on a single stationary sample path and show it is L1-risk consistent.
