  abstract = {In many applications, multiple interlinked sources of data are available and they cannot be represented by a single adjacency matrix, to which large scale factorization method could be applied. Collective matrix factorization is a simple yet powerful  approach to jointly factorize multiple matrices, each of which represents a relation between two entity types.  Existing algorithms to estimate parameters of collective matrix factorization models are based on  non-convex formulations of the problem; in this paper, a convex formulation of this approach is proposed. This enables the derivation of large scale algorithms to estimate the parameters, including an  iterative eigenvalue thresholding algorithm. Numerical experiments illustrate the benefits of this new approach.},
