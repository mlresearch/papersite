  abstract = {We introduce the M-modes problem for graphical models:  predicting the M label configurations of highest probability  that are at the same time local maxima of the probability  landscape. M-modes have multiple possible applications:  because they are intrinsically diverse, they provide a  principled alternative to non-maximum suppression techniques  for structured prediction, they can act as codebook vectors  for quantizing the configuration space, or they can form  component centers for mixture model approximation.  We present two algorithms for solving the M-modes problem. The first algorithm solves the problem in polynomial time  when the underlying graphical model is a simple chain. The second algorithm solves the problem for junction chains.   In synthetic and real dataset, we demonstrate how M-modes  can improve the performance of prediction. We also use the  generated modes as a tool to understand the topography  of the probability distribution of configurations, for example with relation to the training set size and  amount of noise in the data.},
