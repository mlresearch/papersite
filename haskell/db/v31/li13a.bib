  abstract = {Deterministic and near-deterministic relationships among subsets of random variables in multivariate systems are known to cause serious problems for Monte Carlo algorithms. We examine the case in which the relationship $Z = f(X_1,...,X_k)$ holds, where each $X_i$ has a continuous prior pdf and we wish to obtain samples from the conditional distribution $P(X_1,...,X_k | Z= s)$. When $f$ is addition, the problem is NP-hard even when the $X_i$ are independent. In more restricted cases --- for example, i.i.d. Boolean or categorical $X_i$ --- efficient exact samplers have been obtained previously. For the general continuous case, we propose a dynamic scaling algorithm (DYSC), and prove that it has $O(k)$ expected running time and finite variance.  We discuss generalizations of DYSC to functions $f$ described by binary operation trees. We evaluate the algorithm on several examples. },
