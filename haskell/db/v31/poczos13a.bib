  abstract = {Distribution regression refers to the situation where a response $Y$ depends on a covariate $P$ where $P$ is a probability distribution. The model is $Y=f(P) + e$ where $f$ is an unknown regression function and $e$ is a random error. Typically, we do not observe $P$ directly, but rather, we observe a sample from $P$. In this paper we develop theory and methods for distribution-free versions of distribution regression. This means that we do not make strong distributional assumptions about the error term $e$ and covariate $P$. We prove that when the effective dimension is small enough (as measured by the doubling dimension), then the excess prediction risk converges to zero with a polynomial rate.},
