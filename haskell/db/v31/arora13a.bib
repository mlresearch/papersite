  abstract = {Signed permutations (also known as the hyperoctahedral group) are used in modeling genome rearrangements. The algorithmic problems they raise are computationally demanding when not NP-hard.  This paper presents a tractable algorithm for learning consensus ranking between signed permutations under the inversion distance.  This can be extended to estimate a natural class of exponential models over the group of signed permutations. We investigate experimentally the efficiency of our algorithm for modeling data generated by random reversals.},
