  abstract = {Probabilistic modeling of temporal phenomena is of central importance in a variety of fields ranging from neuroscience to economics to speech recognition. While the task has received extensive attention in recent decades, learning temporal models for multivariate real-valued data that is non-Gaussian is still a formidable challenge. Recently, the power of copulas, a framework for representing complex multi-modal and heavy-tailed distributions, was fused with the formalism of Bayesian networks to allow for flexible modeling of high-dimensional distributions. In this work we introduce Dynamic Copula Bayesian Networks, a generalization aimed at capturing the distribution of rich temporal sequences. We apply our model to three markedly different real-life domains and demonstrate substantial quantitative and qualitative advantage.},
