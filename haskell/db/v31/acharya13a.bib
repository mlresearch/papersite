  abstract = {We propose a test that takes random samples drawn from a monotone distribution and decides whether or not the distribution is uniform. The test is nearly optimal in that it uses at most $O(n\sqrt{\log n})$ samples, where $n$ is the number of samples that a genie who knew all but one bit about the underlying distribution would need for the same task. Furthermore, we show that any such test would require $\Omega(n\sqrt{\log n})$ samples for some distributions.},
