  abstract = {We study a model of a stochastic process with unobserved parameters which suddenly change at random times. The possible parameter values are assumed to be from a finite but unknown set. Using a Chinese restaurant process prior over parameters we develop an efficient MCMC procedure for Bayesian inference. We demonstrate the significance of our approach with an application to systems biology data.},
