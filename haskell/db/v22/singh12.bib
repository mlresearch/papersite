  abstract = {Bisubmodularity extends the concept of submodularity to set functions with two arguments. We show how bisubmodular maximization leads to richer value-of-information problems, using examples in sensor placement and feature selection. We present the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for a wide class of bisubmodular maximizations.},
