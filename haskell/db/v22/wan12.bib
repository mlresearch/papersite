  abstract = {This paper introduces a hybrid model that combines a neural network with a latent topic model. The neural network provides a low dimensional embedding for the input data, whose subsequent distribution is captured by the topic model. The neural network thus acts as a trainable feature extractor while the topic model captures the group structure of the data. Following an initial pretraining phase to separately initialize each part of the model, a unified training scheme is introduced that allows for discriminative training of the entire model. The approach is evaluated on visual data in scene classification task, where the hybrid model is shown to outperform models based solely on neural networks or topic models, as well as other baseline methods.},
