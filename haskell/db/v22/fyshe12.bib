  abstract = {In this work, we propose a hierarchical latent dictionary approach to estimate the time-varying mean and covariance of a process for which we have only limited noisy samples.  We fully leverage the limited sample size and redundancy in sensor measurements by transferring knowledge through a hierarchy of lower dimensional latent processes.   As a case study, we utilize Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings of brain activity to identify the word being viewed by a human subject.  Specifically, we identify the word category for a single noisy MEG recording, when given only limited noisy samples on which to train.},
