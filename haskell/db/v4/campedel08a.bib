  abstract = {Satellite images are numerous and weakly exploited: it is urgent to develop efficient and fast  indexing algorithms to facilitate their access. In order to determinate the best features to be  extracted, we propose a methodology based on automatic feature selection algorithms, applied  unsupervisingly on a strongly redundant features set. In this article we also demonstrate the  usefulness of consensus clustering as a feature selection algorithm, allowing selected number  of features estimation and exploration facilities. The efficiency of our approach is demonstrated on SPOT5 images.},
