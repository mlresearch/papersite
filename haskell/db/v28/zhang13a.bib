  abstract = {Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods generally represent each example as a collection of  instances such that the features for local objects can be better captured, whereas traditional learning methods typically extract a global feature vector for each example as an integral part. However, there is limited research work on which of the two learning scenarios performs better. This paper proposes a novel framework -- \emph{Multiple Instance LEArning with  Global Embedding (MILEAGE)}, in which  the global feature vectors for traditional learning methods are integrated into the MIL setting.  MILEAGE can leverage the benefits derived from both learning settings. Within the proposed framework, a large margin method is formulated. In particular,  the proposed method adaptively  tunes the weights on the two different kinds of feature  representations (i.e., global and multiple instance) for each example and trains the classifier simultaneously. An alternative algorithm is proposed to solve the resulting optimization problem, which extends the bundle method to the non-convex case. Some important properties of the proposed method, such as the convergence rate and the generalization error rate, are analyzed. A series of  experiments  have been conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over several state-of-the-art multiple instance and traditional learning methods.},
