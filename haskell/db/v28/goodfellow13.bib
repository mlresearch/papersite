  abstract = {We consider the problem of designing models to leverage a recently introduced approximate model averaging technique called dropout. We dene a simple new model called maxout (so named because its output is the max of a set of inputs, and because it is a natural companion to dropout) designed to both facilitate optimization by dropout and improve the accuracy of dropouts fast approximate model averaging technique. We empirically verify that the model successfully accomplishes both of these tasks. We use maxout and dropout to demonstrate state of the art classication performance on four benchmark datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN.  },
