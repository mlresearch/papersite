  abstract = {We propose a natural cost function for the bi-clustering task, the monochromatic cost.  This cost function is suitable for detecting meaningful homogeneous bi-clusters based on categorical valued input matrices. Such tasks arise in many applications, such as the analysis of social networks and in systems-biology where researchers try to infer functional grouping of biological agents based on their pairwise interactions. We analyze the computational complexity of the resulting optimization problem. We present a polynomial time approximation algorithm for this bi-clustering task and complement this result by showing that finding (exact) optimal solutions is NP-hard. As far as we know, these are the first positive approximation guarantees  and formal NP-hardness results  for any bi-clustering optimization problem.  In addition, we show that our optimization problem can be efficiently  solved by deterministic annealing,  yielding a promising heuristic for large problem instances.},
