  abstract = {We propose and analyze a novel framework for learning sparse representations, based on two statistical techniques: kernel smoothing and marginal regression. The proposed approach provides a flexible framework for incorporating feature similarity or temporal information present in data sets, via nonparametric kernel smoothing. We provide generalization bounds for dictionary learning  using smooth sparse coding and show how the sample complexity depends on the L1 norm of kernel function used. Furthermore, we propose using marginal regression for obtaining sparse codes, which significantly improves the  speed and allows one to scale to large dictionary sizes easily. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach, both in terms of accuracy and speed by extensive experimentation on several real data sets. In addition, we demonstrate how the proposed approach could be used for improving semisupervised sparse coding.},
