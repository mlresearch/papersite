  abstract = {We consider regret minimization in adversarial deterministic Markov  Decision Processes (ADMDPs) with bandit feedback. We devise a new  algorithm that pushes the state-of-the-art forward in two ways: First,  it attains a regret of $O(T^{2/3})$ with respect to the best fixed  policy in hindsight, whereas the previous best regret bound was  $O(T^{3/4})$. Second, the algorithm and its analysis are compatible  with any feasible ADMDP graph topology, while all previous approaches  required additional restrictions on the graph topology.  },
