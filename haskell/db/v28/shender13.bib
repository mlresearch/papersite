  abstract = {We present a family of linear regression estimators that provides a fine-grained tradeoff between statistical accuracy and computational efficiency.  The estimators are based on hard thresholding of the sample covariance matrix entries together with l2-regularizion(ridge regression).  We analyze the predictive risk of this family of estimators as a function of the threshold and regularization parameter.  With appropriate parameter choices, the estimate is the solution to a sparse, diagonally dominant linear system, solvable in near-linear time.  Our analysis shows how the risk varies with the sparsity and regularization level, thus establishing a statistical estimation setting for which there is an explicit, smooth tradeoff between risk and computation.  Simulations are provided to support the theoretical analyses.},
