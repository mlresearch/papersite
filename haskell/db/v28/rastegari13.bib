  abstract = {We propose a Predictable Dual-View Hashing (PDH) algorithm which embeds proximity of data samples in the original spaces. We create a cross-view hamming space with the ability to compare information from previously incomparable domains with a notion of `predictability'.   By performing comparative experimental analysis on two large datasets, PASCAL-Sentence and SUN-Attribute, we demonstrate the superiority of our method to the state-of-the-art dual-view binary code learning algorithms.},
