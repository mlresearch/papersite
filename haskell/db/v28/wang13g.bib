  abstract = {The lack of training data is a common challenge in many machine learning problems, which is often tackled by semi-supervised learning methods or transfer learning methods. The former requires unlabeled images from the same distribution as the labeled ones and the latter leverages labeled images from related homogenous tasks. However, these restrictions often cannot be satisfied. To address this, we propose a novel robust and discriminative self-taught learning approach to utilize any unlabeled data without the above restrictions. Our new approach employs a robust loss function to learn the dictionary, and enforces the structured sparse regularization to automatically select the optimal dictionary basis vectors and incorporate the supervision information contained in the labeled data. We derive an efficient iterative algorithm to solve the optimization problem and rigorously prove its convergence. Promising results in extensive experiments have validated the proposed approach.},
