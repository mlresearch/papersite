  abstract = {Matrix factorization is among the most successful techniques for collaborative filtering. One challenge of collaborative filtering is how to utilize available auxiliary information to improve prediction accuracy. In this paper, we study the  problem of utilizing auxiliary information as features of   factorization and propose formalizing the problem as general functional matrix factorization, whose model includes conventional matrix factorization models as its special cases. Moreover, we propose a gradient boosting based algorithm to efficiently solve the optimization problem. Finally, we give two specific algorithms for efficient feature function construction for two specific tasks. Our method can construct more suitable feature functions by searching in an infinite functional space based on training data and thus can yield better prediction accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the baseline methods on three real-world datasets.},
