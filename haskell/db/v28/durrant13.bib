  abstract = {We derive sharp bounds on the generalization error of a generic linear classifier trained by   empirical risk minimization on randomly-projected data. We make no restrictive assumptions   (such as sparsity or separability) on the data: Instead we use the fact that, in a classification setting, the question of interest is really `what is the effect of random projection on the predicted class labels?' and we therefore derive the exact probability of `label flipping' under Gaussian random projection in order to quantify this effect precisely in our bounds.},
