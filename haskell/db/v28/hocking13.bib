  abstract = {In segmentation models, the number of change-points is typically    chosen using a penalized cost function.  In this work, we propose to    learn the penalty and its constants in databases of signals with    weak change-point annotations. We propose a convex relaxation for    the resulting interval regression problem, and solve it using    accelerated proximal gradient methods. We show that this method    achieves state-of-the-art change-point detection in a database of    annotated DNA copy number profiles from neuroblastoma tumors.},
