  abstract = {We study the sample-complexity of reinforcement learning in a general setting without  assuming ergodicity or finiteness of the environment. Instead, we define a topology  on the space of environments and show that  if an environment class is compact with respect to this topology then finite sample-complexity bounds are possible and give an  algorithm achieving these bounds. We also  show the existence of environment classes  that are non-compact where finite sample-complexity bounds are not achievable. A  lower bound is presented that matches the  upper bound except for logarithmic factors.  },
