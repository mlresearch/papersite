  abstract = {Much natural data is hierarchical in nature. Moreover, this hierarchy  is often shared between different instances. We introduce the  nested Chinese Restaurant Franchise Process as a means to obtain both  hierarchical tree-structured representations for objects, akin to (but more general than) the nested Chinese Restaurant Process while sharing their structure akin  to the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process.     Moreover, by decoupling the \emph{structure generating} part of the  process from the components responsible for the observations, we are  able to apply the same statistical approach to a variety of user  generated data. In particular, we model the joint distribution of  microblogs and locations for Twitter for users. This leads to a 40\%  reduction in location uncertainty relative to the best previously  published results. Moreover, we model documents from the NIPS papers  dataset, obtaining excellent perplexity relative to (hierarchical)  Pachinko allocation and LDA.},
