  abstract = {This paper investigates graph clustering in the planted cluster model in the   presence of  {\em small clusters}. Traditional results dictate that for an   algorithm to provably correctly recover the clusters, {\em all} clusters must be   sufficiently large (in particular, $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{n})$ where $n$ is the number   of nodes of the graph). We show that this is not really a restriction: by a more refined   analysis of the trace-norm based matrix recovery approach proposed in (Jalali et al. 2011) and (Chen et al. 2012), we prove that small clusters, under certain mild assuptions, do not hinder recovery of large ones.  Based on this result, we further devise an iterative algorithm   to recover {\em almost all clusters} via a ``peeling strategy'', i.e., recover large clusters   first, leading to a reduced problem, and repeat this procedure.   These results are extended to the    {\em partial observation} setting, in which only a (chosen) part of the graph is observed.  The peeling strategy gives rise to an active learning algorithm, in which   edges adjacent to smaller clusters are queried more often as large clusters are learned  (and removed).  Our findings are supported by experiments.    From a high level, this paper sheds novel insights on high-dimesional statistics and   learning structured data, by presenting a structured matrix learning problem for which  a one shot convex relaxation approach necessarily fails, but a carefully constructed sequence of convex relaxations  does the job.},
