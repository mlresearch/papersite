  abstract = {Using a well-known industrial case study from the verification literature, the bounded retransmission protocol, we show how active learning can be used to establish the correctness of protocol implementation $I$ relative to a given reference implementation $R$.  Using active learning, we learn a model $M_{R}$ of reference implementation $R$, which serves as input for a model based testing tool that checks conformance of implementation $I$ to $M_{R}$.  In addition, we also explore an alternative approach in which we learn a model $M_{I}$ of implementation $I$, which is compared to model $M_{R}$ using an equivalence checker.  Our work uses a unique combination of software tools for model construction (Uppaal), active learning (LearnLib, Tomte), model-based testing (JTorX, TorXakis) and verification (CADP, MRMC).  We show how these tools can be used for learning these models, analyzing the obtained results, and improving the learning performance.},
