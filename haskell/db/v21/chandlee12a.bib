  abstract = {This paper presents a method for the control synthesis of robotic   systems in an unknown, dynamic, and adversarial environments. We (1)   incorporate a grammatical inference module that identifies the   governing dynamics of the adversarial environment and (2) utilize   game theory to compute a motion plan for a system given a task   specification. The framework is flexible and modular since different   games can be formulated for different system objectives and   different grammatical inference algorithms can be utilized depending   on the abstract nature of the dynamic environment.},
