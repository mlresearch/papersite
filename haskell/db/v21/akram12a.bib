  abstract = {In this paper we investigate learning of probabilistic subsequential   transducers in an active learning environment. In our learning   algorithm the learner interacts with an oracle by asking   probabilistic queries on the observed data. We prove our algorithm   in an identification in the limit model. We also provide   experimental evidence to show the correctness and to analyze the   learnability of the proposed algorithm.},
