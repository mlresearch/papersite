  abstract = {In this paper, we tackle the task of graph language learning. We   first extend the well-known classes of \emph{k-testability} and   \emph{k-testability in the strict sense} languages to directed graph   languages. Second, we propose a graph automata model for directed   acyclic graph languages. This graph automata model is used to   propose a grammatical inference algorithm to learn the class of   directed acyclic \emph{k}-testable in the strict sense graph   languages. The algorithm runs in polynomial time and identifies this   class of languages from positive data.},
