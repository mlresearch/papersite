  abstract = {Answer summarization is an important problem in the study of Question and Answering. In this paper, we deal with the general questions with ``YesâNo'' answers in English. We design 1) a model to score the relevance of the answers and the questions, and 2) a feature function combining the relevance and opinion scores to classify each answer to be ``Yes'', ``No'' or ``Neutral''. We combine the opinion features together with two weighting scores to solve this problem and conduct experiments on a real word dataset. Given an input question, the system firstly detects if it can be simply answered by ``Yes/No'' or not, and then outputs the resulting voting numbers of ``Yes'' answers and ``No'' answers to this question. We also first proposed the accuracy, precision, and recall to the ``Yes/No'' answer detection.},
