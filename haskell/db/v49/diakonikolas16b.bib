  abstract = {We give an algorithm for properly learning Poisson binomial distributions.
A Poisson binomial distribution (PBD) of order $n \in \mathbb{Z}_+$
is the discrete probability distribution of the sum of $n$ mutually independent Bernoulli random variables.
Given $\widetilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ samples from an unknown PBD $P$, our algorithm runs in time
$(1/\eps)^{O(\log \log (1/\epsilon))}$, and outputs a hypothesis PBD that is $\epsilon$-close to $P$ in total variation distance.
The sample complexity of our algorithm is known to be nearly-optimal, up to logarithmic factors, as established
in previous work. However, the previously best known running time for properly
learning PBDs was $(1/\epsilon)^{O(\log(1/\epsilon))}$, and was essentially obtained by
enumeration over an appropriate  $\epsilon$-cover. We remark that the running time of this cover-based approach cannot be
improved, as any $\epsilon$-cover for the space of PBDs has size  $(1/\epsilon)^{\Omega(\log(1/\epsilon))}$.

As one of our main contributions, we provide a novel structural characterization of PBDs,
showing that any PBD $P$ is $\epsilon$-close to another PBD $Q$ with $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ distinct parameters.
More precisely, we prove that, for all $\epsilon >0,$ there exists
an explicit collection $\cal{M}$ of $(1/\epsilon)^{O(\log \log (1/\epsilon))}$ vectors of multiplicities,
such that for any PBD $P$ there exists a PBD $Q$ with $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ distinct parameters whose multiplicities are given by some element of ${\cal M}$,
such that $Q$ is $\epsilon$-close to $P.$  Our proof combines tools from Fourier analysis and algebraic geometry.


Our approach to the proper learning problem is as follows:
Starting with an accurate non-proper hypothesis, we fit a PBD to this hypothesis.
This fitting problem can be formulated as a natural polynomial optimization problem.
Our aforementioned structural characterization allows
us to reduce the corresponding fitting problem
to a collection of $(1/\epsilon)^{O(\log \log(1/\epsilon))}$
systems of low-degree polynomial inequalities.
We show that each such system can be solved in time $(1/\epsilon)^{O(\log \log(1/\epsilon))}$,
which yields the overall running time of our algorithm.
