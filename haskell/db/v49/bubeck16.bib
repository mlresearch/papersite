  abstract = {We construct a new map from a convex function to a distribution on its domain, with the property that this distribution is a multi-scale exploration of the function. We use this map to solve a decade-old open problem in adversarial bandit convex optimization by showing that the minimax regret for this problem is $\tilde{O}(\mathrm{poly}(n) \sqrt{T})$, where $n$ is the dimension and $T$ the number of rounds. This bound is obtained by studying the dual Bayesian maximin regret via the information ratio analysis of Russo and Van Roy, and then using the multi-scale exploration to construct a new algorithm for the Bayesian convex bandit problem.},
