  abstract = {If a concept class can be represented with a certain amount of memory, can it be efficiently learned
with the same amount of memory? What concepts can be efficiently learned by algorithms that
extract only a few bits of information from each example? We introduce a formal framework for
studying these questions, and investigate the relationship between the fundamental resources of
memory or communication and the sample complexity of the learning task. We relate our memory-bounded
and communication-bounded learning models to the well-studied statistical query model. This connection
can be leveraged to obtain both upper and lower bounds: we show strong lower bounds on learning parity
functions with bounded communication, as well as upper bounds on solving sparse linear regression
problems with limited memory.},
