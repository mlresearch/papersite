  abstract = {We present a general framework for proving
polynomial sample complexity bounds for the problem
of learning from samples the best auction in a class
of ``simple'' auctions.  Our framework captures the
most prominent examples of ``simple'' auctions,
including anonymous and non-anonymous item and
bundle pricings, with either a single or multiple
buyers.  The first step of the framework is to show
that the set of auction allocation rules have a
low-dimensional representation.  The second step
shows that, across the subset of auctions that share
the same allocations on a given set of samples, the
auction revenue varies in a low-dimensional way.
Our results effectively imply that whenever it is
possible to compute a near-optimal simple auction
with a known prior, it is also possible to compute
such an auction with an unknown prior, given a
polynomial number of samples. },
