  abstract = {Ranking from pairwise
comparisons is a ubiquitous problem and has been studied in disciplines
ranging from statistics to operations research and from theoretical computer
science to machine learning. Here we consider a general setting where
outcomes of pairwise comparisons between items $i$ and $j$ are drawn
probabilistically by flipping a coin with unknown bias $P_{ij}$ , and ask under
what conditions on these unknown probabilities one can learn a good ranking
from comparisons of only $O(n\log(n))$ non-actively chosen pairs. Recent work has
established this is possible under the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) and noisy
permutation (NP) models. Here we introduce a broad family of ‘low-rank’
conditions on the probabilities $P_{ij}$ under which the resulting preference
matrix $P$ has low rank under some link function, and show these conditions
encompass the BTL and Thurstone classes as special cases, but are
considerably more general. We then give a new algorithm called low-rank
pairwise ranking (LRPR) which provably learns a good ranking from comparisons
of only $O(n\log(n))$ randomly chosen comparisons under such low-rank models. Our
algorithm and analysis make use of tools from the theory of low-rank matrix
completion, and provide a new perspective on the problem of ranking from
pairwise comparisons in non-active settings.},
