  abstract = {This work studies the maximum
possible sign rank of $N \times N$ sign matrices with a given
VC dimension $d$.
For $d=1$, this maximum is {three}.
For $d=2$, this maximum is $\tilde{\Theta}(N^{1/2})$.
For $d >2$, similar but slightly less accurate statements hold.
Our lower bounds improve over previous ones
by Ben-David et al.~and can be interpreted as exhibiting
a weakness of kernel-based classifiers.
Our upper bounds, on the other hand,
can be interpreted as exhibiting the universality
of kernel-based classifiers.

The lower bounds are obtained by probabilistic constructions,
using a theorem of Warren in real algebraic topology.
The upper bounds are obtained using
a result of Welzl about spanning trees with low stabbing number,
and using the moment curve.

The upper bound technique is also used to:
(i) provide estimates on the number of classes
of a given VC dimension,
and the number of maximum
classes of a given VC dimension -- answering a question of Frankl from '89,
and (ii) design an efficient
algorithm that provides an $O(N/\log(N))$ multiplicative
approximation for the sign rank
(computing the sign rank is equivalent to the existential theory of the reals).


We also observe a general connection between sign rank
and spectral gaps which is based on Forster's argument.
Consider the $N \times N$ adjacency matrix of a $\Delta$ regular graph
with a second eigenvalue of absolute value $\lambda$ and
$\Delta \leq N/2$.
We show that the sign rank of the signed version of this matrix
is at least $\Delta/\lambda$.
We use this connection to prove the existence
of a maximum class $C\subseteq\{\pm 1\}^N$ with VC dimension $2$
and sign rank $\tilde{\Theta}(N^{1/2})$. This answers a question of
Ben-David et al.~regarding the sign rank of large VC classes.
We also describe limitations of this approach,
in the spirit of the Alon-Boppana theorem.

We further describe connections to communication complexity, geometry,
learning theory, and combinatorics.},
