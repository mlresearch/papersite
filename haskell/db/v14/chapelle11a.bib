  abstract = {Learning to rank for information retrieval has gained a lot of interest in the recent years but there is a lack for large real-world datasets to benchmark algorithms. That led us to publicly release two datasets used internally at Yahoo! for learning the web search ranking function. To promote these datasets and foster the development of state-of-the-art learning to rank algorithms, we organized the Yahoo! Learning to Rank Challenge in spring 2010. This paper provides an overview and an analysis of this challenge, along with a detailed description of the released datasets.},
