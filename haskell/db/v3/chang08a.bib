  abstract = {Feature ranking is useful to gain knowledge of data and identify relevant   features. This article explores the performance of combining linear support   vector machines with various feature ranking methods, and reports the experiments   conducted when participating the Causality Challenge. Experiments show that   a feature ranking using weights from linear SVM models yields good performances,   even when the training and testing data are not identically distributed.  Checking the difference of Area Under Curve (AUC) with and without removing  each feature also gives similar rankings. Our study indicates that linear   SVMs with simple feature rankings are effective on data sets in the Causality  Challenge.},
