  abstract = {The random sets approach is heuristic in nature and has been inspired by  the growing speed of computations. For example, we can consider a large number  of classifiers where any single classifier is based on a relatively small  subset of randomly selected features or random sets of features. Using cross-validation  we can rank all random sets according to the selected criterion, and use this ranking for further feature selection. Another application of random sets was motivated by the huge imbalanced data, which represent significant  problem because the corresponding classifier has a tendency to ignore patterns with smaller representation in the training set. Again, we propose to consider  a large number of balanced training subsets where representatives from both  patterns are selected randomly. The above models demonstrated competitive  results in two data mining competitions.},
