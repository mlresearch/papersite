  abstract = {Given a dictionary $\Pi$ and a signal $\xi = \Pi \mathbf x$ generated by a few \textit{linearly independent} columns of $\Pi$, classical sparse recovery theory deals with the problem of uniquely recovering the sparse representation $\mathbf x$ of $\xi$. In this work, we consider the more general case where $\xi$ lies in a low-dimensional subspace spanned by a few columns of $\Pi$, which are possibly \textit{linearly dependent}. In this case, $\mathbf x$ may not unique, and the goal is to recover any subset of the columns of $\Pi$ that spans the subspace containing $\xi$. We call such a representation $\mathbf x$ \textit{subspace-sparse}. We study conditions under which existing pursuit methods recover a subspace-sparse representation. Such conditions reveal important geometric insights and have implications for the theory of classical sparse recovery as well as subspace clustering.},
