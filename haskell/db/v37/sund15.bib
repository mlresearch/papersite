  abstract = {We consider the problem of recovering a complete (i.e., square and invertible) dictionary $mb A_0$, from $mb Y = mb A_0 mb X_0$ with $mb Y \in \mathbb R^{n \times p}$. This recovery setting is central to the theoretical understanding of dictionary learning. We give the first efficient algorithm that provably recovers $mb A_0$ when $mb X_0$ has $O(n)$ nonzeros per column, under suitable probability model for $mb X_0$. Prior results provide recovery guarantees when $mb X_0$ has only $O(\sqrt{n})$ nonzeros per column. Our algorithm is based on nonconvex optimization with a spherical constraint, and hence is naturally phrased in the language of manifold optimization. Our proofs give a geometric characterization of the high-dimensional objective landscape, which shows that with high probability there are no spurious local minima. Experiments with synthetic data corroborate our theory. Full version of this paper is available online: \url{http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06785}.},
