  abstract = {We consider the infinite-horizon $\gamma$-discounted optimal control problem formalized by Markov Decision Processes. Running any instance of Modified Policy Iteration---a family of algorithms that can interpolate between Value and Policy Iteration---with an error $\epsilon$ at each iteration is known to lead to stationary policies that are at least $\frac{2\gamma\epsilon}{(1-\gamma)^2}$-optimal. Variations of Value and Policy Iteration, that build $\ell$-periodic non-stationary policies, have recently been shown to display a better $\frac{2\gamma\epsilon}{(1-\gamma)(1-\gamma^\ell)}$-optimality guarantee. Our first contribution is to describe a new algorithmic scheme, Non-Stationary Modified Policy Iteration, a family of algorithms parameterized by two integers $m \ge 0$ and $\ell \ge 1$ that generalizes all the above mentionned algorithms. While $m$ allows to interpolate between Value-Iteration-style and Policy-Iteration-style updates, $\ell$ specifies the period of the non-stationary policy that is output. We show that this new family of algorithms also enjoys the improved $\frac{2\gamma\epsilon}{(1-\gamma)(1-\gamma^\ell)}$-optimality guarantee. Perhaps more importantly, we show, by exhibiting an original problem instance, that this guarantee is tight for all $m$ and $\ell$; this tightness was to our knowledge only proved two specific cases, Value Iteration $(m=0,\ell=1)$ and Policy Iteration $(m=\infty,\ell=1)$.},
