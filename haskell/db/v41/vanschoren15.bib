  abstract = {OpenML is an online platform where scientists can automatically log and share machine
learning data sets, code, and experiments, organize them online, and build directly on the
work of others. It helps to automate many tedious aspects of research, is readily integrated
into several machine learning tools, and offers easy-to-use APIs. It also enables large-scale
and real-time collaboration, allowing researchers to share their very latest results, while
keeping track of their impact and reuse. The combined and linked results provide a wealth
of information to speed up research, assist people while analyzing data, or automate the
process altogether.},
