  abstract = {In this industrial application paper a novel application of salad leaf disease detection has been developed using a combination of big data analytics and on field multi-dimensional sensing. We propose a cloud computing based intelligent big data analysis and interactive visual analytics platform to predict farm hot spots with high probability of potential biosecurity threats and early monitoring system aiming to save the farm from significant economic damage. },
