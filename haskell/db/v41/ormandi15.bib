  abstract = {We consider the problem of estimating occurrence rates of rare events for
extremely sparse data using pre-existing hierarchies and selected features to
perform inference along multiple dimensions. In particular, we focus on the
problem of estimating click rates for \{Advertiser, Publisher, User\} tuples
where both the Advertisers and the Publishers are organized as hierarchies that 
capture broad contextual information at different levels of granularities. 
Typically, the click rates are low and the coverage of the hierarchies and
dimensions is sparse. To overcome these difficulties, we decompose the joint
prior of the three-dimensional  Click-Through-Rate (CTR) using tensor
decomposition and propose a Multidimensional 
Hierarchical Bayesian framework (abbreviated as MadHab).
We set up a specific  framework of each dimension to model dimension-specific
characteristics. More specifically, we consider the hierarchical beta process prior for the
Advertiser dimension and for the Publisher
dimension  respectively and a feature-dependent mixture model for the User dimension. 
Besides the centralized implementation, we propose a distributed algorithm
through Spark for inference which make the model highly scalable and suited for large scale
data mining applications.
We demonstrate that on a real world ads campaign platform our framework can 
effectively discriminate extremely rare events in terms of their click propensity.},
