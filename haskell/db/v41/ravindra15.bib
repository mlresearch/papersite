  abstract = {Clustering is a central problem in non-relational data analysis, with $k$-means being the most popular clustering 
    technique. In various scenarios, it may be necessary to perform clustering over the same input data multiple times -- with 
    different values of $k$, different clustering attributes, or different initial centroids -- before arriving at the final solution. 
    In this paper, we propose algorithms for parallel execution of multiple runs of $k$-means clustering in a way that achieves
    substantial savings of IO and processing resources. Proposed algorithms can easily be implemented over Hadoop/MapReduce, Spark, 
    etc., with savings in \textit{map} and \textit{reduce} phases. Extensive performance evaluation using real-world datasets show 
    that the proposed algorithms result in up to 40\% savings in response times when compared to other optimization techniques 
    proposed in literature as well as open-source implementations. The algorithms scale well with increasing data sizes, values 
    of $k$, and number of clustering tasks.},
