  abstract = {Word alignment is to estimate a lexical translation probability \emph{p}(\emph{e}|\emph{f}), or to estimate the correspondence \emph{g}(\emph{e},\emph{f}) where a function \emph{g} outputs either 0 or 1, between a source word \emph{f} and a target word \emph{e} for given bilingual sentences. In practice, this formulation does not consider the existence of 'noise' (or outlier) which may cause problems depending on the corpus. \emph{N}-to-\emph{m} mapping objects, such as paraphrases, non-literal translations, and multi-word expressions, may appear as both noise and also as valid training data. From this perspective, this paper tries to answer the following two questions: 1) how to detect stable patterns where noise seems legitimate, and 2) how to reduce such noise, where applicable, by supplying extra information as prior knowledge to a word aligner.},
