  abstract = {We describe our solution for the KDD Cup 2011 track 2 challenge. Our solution relies heavily on ensembling together diverse individual models for the prediction task, and achieved a final leaderboard/Test 1 misclassification rate of 3.8863\%. This paper provides details on both the modeling and ensemble creation steps.},
