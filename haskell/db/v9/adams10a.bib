  abstract = {Deep belief networks are a powerful way to model complex probability   distributions.  However, it is difficult to learn the structure of a   belief network, particularly one with hidden units.  The Indian   buffet process has been used as a nonparametric Bayesian prior on   the structure of a directed belief network with a single infinitely   wide hidden layer. Here, we introduce the cascading Indian   buffet process (CIBP), which provides a prior on the structure of a   layered, directed belief network that is unbounded in both depth and   width, yet allows tractable inference.  We use the CIBP prior with   the nonlinear Gaussian belief network framework to allow each unit   to vary its behavior between discrete and continuous   representations.  We use Markov chain Monte Carlo for inference in   this model and explore the structures learned on image data.},
