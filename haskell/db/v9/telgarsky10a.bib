  abstract = {Hartigan's method for k-means clustering is the following greedy heuristic: select a point, and optimally reassign it.  This paper develops two other formulations of the heuristic, one leading to a number of consistency properties, the other showing that the data partition is always quite separated from the induced Voronoi partition.  A characterization of the volume of this separation is provided.  Empirical tests verify not only good optimization performance relative to Lloyd's method, but also good running time.},
