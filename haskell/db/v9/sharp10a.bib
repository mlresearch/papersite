  abstract = {We describe a novel inference algorithm for sparse Bayesian PCA with a  zero-norm prior on the model parameters. Bayesian inference is very  challenging in probabilistic models of this type. MCMC procedures are  too slow to be practical in a very high-dimensional setting and standard  mean-field variational Bayes algorithms are ineffective.  We adopt a  dense message passing algorithm similar to algorithms developed in the  statistical  physics community and previously applied to inference  problems in coding and sparse classification. The algorithm achieves  near-optimal performance on synthetic data for which a statistical  mechanics theory of optimal learning can be derived. We also study two  gene expression datasets used in previous studies of sparse PCA. We find our  method  performs better than one published algorithm and comparably to a second.},
