  abstract = {Working within the decision-theoretic framework for causal inference, we study the properties of ``sufficient covariates", which support causal inference from observational data, and possibilities for their reduction. In particular we illustrate the role of a propensity variable by means of a simple model, and explain why such a reduction typically does not increase (and may reduce) estimation efficiency.},
