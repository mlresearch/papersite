  abstract = {We want to sketch the support of a probability measure on Euclidean    space from samples that have been drawn from the measure. This    problem is closely related to certain manifold learning problems,    where one assumes that the sample points are drawn from a manifold    that is embedded in Euclidean space. Here we propose to sketch the    support of the probability measure (that does not need to be a    manifold) by some gradient flow complex, or more precisely by its    Hasse diagram. The gradient flow is defined with respect to the    distance function to the sample points. We prove that a gradient    flow complex (that can be computed) is homotopy equivalent to the    support of the measure for sufficiently dense samplings, and    demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on real world data sets.},
