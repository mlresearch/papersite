  abstract = {Using statistical emulators to guide sequential evaluations of complex computer experiments is now  a well-established practice. When a model provides multiple outputs, a typical objective is to optimize one of the outputs   with constraints (for instance, a threshold not to exceed) on the values of the other outputs.   We propose here a new optimization strategy based on the stepwise uncertainty reduction paradigm,   which offers an efficient trade-off between exploration and local search near the boundaries.  The strategy is illustrated on numerical examples.},
