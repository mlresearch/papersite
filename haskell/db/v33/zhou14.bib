  abstract = {In this paper, we present an efficient Multi-class  Heterogeneous Domain Adaptation (HDA)  method, where data from the source and target domains are  represented by heterogeneous features with different dimensions.  Specifically, we propose to reconstruct a sparse feature  transformation matrix to map the features of multiple classes from  the source domain to the target domain. We  cast this  learning task as a compressed sensing problem, where each classifier  can be deemed as a measurement sensor. Based on compressive  sensing theory, the estimation error of the transformation matrix  decreases with the increasing number of classifiers. Therefore, to  guarantee the reconstruction performance, we construct  sufficiently many binary classifiers based on the error correcting output  correcting. Extensive experiments are conducted on  both toy data and three real-world HDA applications to verify the  superiority of our proposed method over existing state-of-the-art  HDA methods in terms of prediction accuracy.},
