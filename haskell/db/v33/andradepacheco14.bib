  abstract = {Machine learning practitioners are often faced with a choice between a discriminative and a generative approach to modelling. Here, we present a model based on a hybrid approach that breaks down some of the barriers between the discriminative and generative points of view, allowing continuous dimensionality reduction of hybrid discrete-continuous data, discriminative classification with missing inputs and manifold learning informed by class labels.},
