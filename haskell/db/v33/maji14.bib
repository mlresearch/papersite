  abstract = {We address the problem of efficiently annotating labels of objects when they are structured. Often the distribution over labels can be described using a joint potential function over the labels for which sampling is provably hard but efficient maximum a-posteriori (MAP) solvers exist. In this setting we develop novel entropy bounds that are based on the expected amount of perturbation to the potential function that is needed to change MAP decisions. By reasoning about the entropy reduction and cost tradeoff, our algorithm actively selects the next annotation task. As an example of our framework we propose a boundary refinement task which can used to obtain pixel-accurate image boundaries much faster than traditional tools by focussing on parts of the image for refinement in a multi-scale manner.},
