  abstract = {This theoretical paper is concerned with the structure learning limit for Gaussian Markov random fields from i.i.d. samples. The common strategy is applying the Fano method to a family of restricted ensembles. The efficiency of this method, however, depends crucially on selected restricted ensembles. To break through this limitation, we analyze the whole graph ensemble from high-dimensional geometric and group-theoretical perspectives. The key ingredients of our approach are the geometric property of concentration matrices and the invariance of orthogonal group actions on the symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence. We then establish the connection of the learning limit and eigenvalues of concentration matrices, which leads to a sharper structure learning limit. To our best knowledge, this is the first paper to consider the structure learning problem via inherent symmetries of the whole ensemble. Finally, our approach can be applicable to other graphical structure learning problems.},
