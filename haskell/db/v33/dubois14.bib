  abstract = {In this paper, we advance the theory of large scale Bayesian posterior inference by introducing a new approximate slice sampler that uses only small mini-batches of data in every iteration. While this introduces a bias in the stationary distribution, the computational savings allow us to draw more samples in a given amount of time and reduce sampling variance. We empirically verify on three  different models that the approximate slice sampling algorithm can significantly outperform a traditional slice sampler if we are allowed only a fixed amount of computing time for our simulations.},
