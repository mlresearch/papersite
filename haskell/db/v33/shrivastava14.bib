  abstract = {MinHash and SimHash are the two widely adopted Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) algorithms for large-scale data processing applications. Deciding which LSH to use for a particular problem at hand is an important question, which has no clear answer in the existing  literature. In this study, we provide a theoretical answer (validated by experiments) that MinHash virtually always outperforms  SimHash when the data are binary, as common in practice such as search.      The collision probability of MinHash is a function of  {\em resemblance} similarity ($\mathcal{R}$), while the collision probability of SimHash is a function of  {\em cosine}  similarity ($\mathcal{S}$). To provide a common basis for  comparison,  we evaluate  retrieval results in terms of $\mathcal{S}$ for both MinHash and SimHash. This evaluation is valid  as we can prove that MinHash is  a valid LSH with respect to $\mathcal{S}$, by using a  general inequality  $\mathcal{S}^2\leq \mathcal{R}\leq \frac{\mathcal{S}}{2-\mathcal{S}}$. Our \textbf{worst case}  analysis  can show that MinHash significantly outperforms SimHash in  \textbf{high similarity} region.        Interestingly, our intensive experiments reveal that MinHash is also substantially better than SimHash even in datasets where most of the data points are not too similar to each other. This is partly because, in practical data, often $\mathcal{R}\geq \frac{\mathcal{S}}{z-\mathcal{S}}$ holds where $z$ is only slightly larger than 2 (e.g., $z\leq 2.1$). Our \textbf{restricted worst case} analysis by assuming $\frac{\mathcal{S}}{z-\mathcal{S}}\leq \mathcal{R}\leq \frac{\mathcal{S}}{2-\mathcal{S}}$ shows that MinHash indeed significantly outperforms SimHash even in \textbf{low similarity} region.        We believe the results in this paper  will provide valuable guidelines for search in practice,  especially when the data are sparse.},
