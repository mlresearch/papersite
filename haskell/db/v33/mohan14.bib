  abstract = {Graphical models that depict the process by which data are lost are helpful in recovering information from missing data. We address the question of whether any such model can be submitted to a statistical test given that the data available are corrupted by missingness. We present sufficient conditions for testability in missing data applications and note the impediments for testability when data are contaminated by missing entries. Our results strengthen the available tests for MCAR and MAR and further provide tests in the category of MNAR. Furthermore, we provide sufficient conditions to detect the existence of dependence between a variable and its missingness mechanism. We use our results to show that model sensitivity persists in    almost all models typically categorized as MNAR.},
