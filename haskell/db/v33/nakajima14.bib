  abstract = {Variational Bayesian (VB) learning is known to be a   promising   approximation to Bayesian learning  with computational efficiency.  However, in some applications,  e.g., large-scale collaborative filtering and tensor factorization,  VB is still computationally too costly.  In such cases,   looser approximations  such as MAP estimation and partially Bayesian (PB) learning,  where a part of the parameters are point-estimated,  seem attractive.  In this paper,   we theoretically investigate the behavior of the MAP and the PB solutions of matrix factorization.  A notable finding is that the global solutions of MAP and PB in the empirical Bayesian scenario,  where the hyperparameters are also estimated from observation,  are trivial and useless,  while  their local solutions behave similarly to the global solution of VB.  This suggests that empirical MAP and empirical PB with local search can be alternatives to empirical VB  equipped with the useful automatic relevance determination property.  Experiments support our theory.},
