  abstract = {This paper presents and proves an extension of Meek's conjecture to chain graphs under the Lauritzen-Wermuth-Frydenberg interpretation. The proof of the conjecture leads to the development of a structure learning algorithm that finds an inclusion optimal chain graph for any given probability distribution satisfying the composition property. Finally, the new algorithm is experimentally evaluated.},
