  abstract = {Gaussian processes are a state-of-the-art method for learning    models from data. Data with an underlying periodic structure appears    in many areas, e.g., in climatology or robotics.  It is often    important to predict the long-term evolution of such a time series,    and to take the inherent periodicity explicitly into account.  In a    Gaussian process, periodicity can be accounted for by an appropriate kernel    choice. However, the standard periodic kernel does not allow for    analytic long-term forecasting, which requires to map distributions    through the Gaussian process.  To address this shortcoming, we re-parametrize the periodic kernel,    which, in combination with a double approximation, allows for    analytic long-term forecasting of a periodic state evolution with    Gaussian processes.  Our model allows for probabilistic long-term forecasting of periodic    processes, which can be valuable in Bayesian decision making,    optimal control, reinforcement learning, and robotics.},
