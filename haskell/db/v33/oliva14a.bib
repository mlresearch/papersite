  abstract = {We study the problem of distribution to real regression, where one aims to regress a mapping $f$ that takes in a distribution input covariate $P\in \mathcal{I}$ (for a non-parametric family of distributions $\mathcal{I}$) and outputs a real-valued response $Y=f(P) + \epsilon$.   This setting was recently studied in PÃ³zcos et al.\ (2013), where the ``Kernel-Kernel'' estimator was introduced and shown to have a polynomial rate of convergence.   However, evaluating a new prediction with the Kernel-Kernel estimator scales as $\Omega(N)$. This causes the difficult situation where a large amount of data may be necessary for a low estimation risk, but the computation cost of estimation becomes infeasible when the data-set is too large. To this end, we propose the Double-Basis estimator, which looks to alleviate this big data problem in two ways: first, the Double-Basis estimator is shown to have a computation complexity that is independent of the number of of instances $N$ when evaluating new predictions after training; secondly, the Double-Basis estimator is shown to have a fast rate of convergence for a general class of mappings $f\in\mathcal{F}$.},
