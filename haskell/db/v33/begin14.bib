  abstract = {We propose a PAC-Bayesian analysis of the transductive learning setting, introduced by Vapnik [2008], by proposing a family of new bounds on the generalization error. Some of them are derived from their counterpart in the inductive setting, and others are new. We also compare their behavior.},
