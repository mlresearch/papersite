  abstract = {Temporal queries on time evolving data are at the heart of a broad range of business and network intelligence applications ranging from consumer behavior analysis, trend analysis, temporal pattern mining, sentiment analysis on social media, cyber security, and network monitoring. In this work, we present an innovative data structure called Fast Approximate Query-able(FAQ) which provides a unified framework for temporal query processing on Big Data. FAQ uses a novel composition of data sketching, wavelet-style differencing for temporal compression, and quantization, and handles diverse kinds of queries including distinct counts, set membership, frequency estimation, top-K, p-norms, empirical entropy, and distance queries such as Histogram $\ell_p$-norm distance (including Euclidean and Manhattan distance), cosine similarity, Jaccard coefficient, and rank correlation. Experiments on a real-life multi dimensional network monitoring data sets demonstrate speedups of 92x achieved by FAQ over a flat representation of data for a mixed temporal query workload.},
