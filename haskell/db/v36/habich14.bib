  abstract = {Data Clustering is an important and highly utilized data mining technique in various application domains. With ever increasing data volumes in the era of big data, the efficient execution of clustering algorithms is a fundamental prerequisite to gain understanding and acquire novel, previously unknown knowledge from data. To establish an efficient execution, the clustering algorithms have to be re-engineered to fully exploit the provided hardware capabilities. Shared-memory multiprocessor systems like graphics processing units (GPUs) provide extremely high parallelism combined with a high bandwidth transfer at low cost. The availability of such computing units increases with upcoming processors, where a common CPU and various computing units, like GPU, are tightly coupled using a unified shared memory hierarchy. In this paper, we consider density-based clustering for such heterogeneous systems. In particular, we optimize the configuration of CUDA-DClust -- a density-based clustering algorithm for GPUs -- and show that our configuration approach enables an efficient and deterministic execution. Our configuration approach is based on data as well as hardware properties, so that we are able to adjust the algorithm execution in both directions. In our evaluation, we show the applicability of our approach and present open challenges which have to be solved next.},
