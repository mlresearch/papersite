  abstract = {In large scale learning, disk I/O for data loading is often the runtime bottleneck. We propose a lossy data compression scheme with a fast decompression to reduce disk I/O, allocating fewer than the standard 32 bits for each real value in the data set. We theoretically show that the estimation error induced by the loss in compression decreases exponentially with the number of the bits used per value. Our experiments show the proposed method achieves excellent performance with a small number of bits and substantial speedups during training.},
