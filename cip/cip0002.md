# CIP-0002: Testing Framework and Conventions

## Summary
Introduce a robust Ruby testing framework for the project, establish conventions for writing and organizing tests, and ensure a foundation for reliable, maintainable code.

## Motivation
Currently, the project lacks a standardized approach to automated testing. This makes it difficult to verify code correctness, safely refactor, and confidently add new features. A well-integrated testing framework will improve code quality, facilitate collaboration, and support future development.

## Detailed Description
This CIP proposes:
- Evaluating popular Ruby testing frameworks (e.g., RSpec, Minitest)
- Selecting the most appropriate framework for the project's needs
- Integrating the chosen framework into the codebase
- Establishing conventions for test organization, naming, and structure
- Adding initial example tests for key scripts (e.g., tidy_bib_unicode.rb)
- Documenting testing practices for contributors

## Implementation Plan
1. *Evaluate Testing Frameworks*
   - Compare RSpec, Minitest, and any other relevant options
   - Consider ease of use, community support, and compatibility

2. *Select and Integrate Framework*
   - Add the chosen framework as a dependency
   - Set up directory structure for tests (e.g., `spec/` or `test/`)
   - Configure test runner and helper files

3. *Establish Conventions and Add Example Tests*
   - Define naming and organization conventions
   - Write example tests for `tidy_bib_unicode.rb` and other core scripts
   - Ensure tests can be run easily (e.g., via `rake` or a simple command)

4. *Document Testing Practices*
   - Add documentation to the repository (e.g., in `README.md` or a dedicated file)
   - Provide guidance for contributors on writing and running tests

## Backward Compatibility
This change is additive and will not affect existing code. No changes are required for users who do not run tests.

## Testing Strategy
- The framework selection will be validated by running example tests
- Contributors will be encouraged to add tests for new features and bug fixes
- CI integration may be considered in the future

## Related Requirements
This CIP addresses the following requirements:
- [Link to requirements document 1]
- [Link to requirements document 2]

Specifically, it implements solutions for:
- Establishing automated testing
- Improving code reliability
- Supporting maintainable development

## Implementation Status
- [x] Evaluate testing frameworks (Test::Unit used in CIP-0003 implementation)
- [ ] Select and integrate framework (Test::Unit proven viable for project)
- [x] Add example tests and conventions (comprehensive test suite created for tidy_bibtex.rb)
- [x] Document testing practices (test/README.md created for CIP-0003)

## Progress Through CIP-0003 Implementation

The testing framework requirements from this CIP have been partially addressed through the implementation of CIP-0003 (BibTeX File Format Validation and Cleaning). This provides valuable insights for the broader testing framework:

### What We've Learned
- **Test::Unit works well** for this project's Ruby scripts
- **Simple test structure** with `test/` directory is effective
- **Comprehensive test coverage** is achievable with Test::Unit
- **Documentation approach** in `test/README.md is effective

### Current Implementation (from CIP-0003)
- Test suite for `lib/tidy_bibtex.rb` with 15+ test cases
- Covers auto-detection, issue detection/fixing, command-line options, edge cases
- Uses temporary directories for test isolation
- Includes both automated and manual testing approaches

### Next Steps for Full CIP-0002 Implementation
- Extend Test::Unit framework to other core scripts (`tidy_bib_unicode.rb`, `create_volume.rb`, etc.)
- Establish project-wide testing conventions based on CIP-0003 patterns
- Create test runners for different script categories
- Integrate testing into development workflow

### Recent Progress (2025-10-05)
- **Test suite validated locally**: 15 tests, 29 assertions, 100% passed
- **Manual validation working**: All 4 test scenarios passed
- **Script functionality confirmed**: All command-line options working
- **Auto-detection tested**: Single file detection working correctly
- **Issue detection/fixing verified**: Percent and author field issues handled
- **End-to-end workflow validated**: Complete processing pipeline functional
- **GitHub Action backlog created**: Ready for CI/CD integration
