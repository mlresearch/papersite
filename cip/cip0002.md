# CIP-0002: Testing Framework and Conventions

## Summary
Introduce a robust Ruby testing framework for the project, establish conventions for writing and organizing tests, and ensure a foundation for reliable, maintainable code.

## Motivation
Currently, the project lacks a standardized approach to automated testing. This makes it difficult to verify code correctness, safely refactor, and confidently add new features. A well-integrated testing framework will improve code quality, facilitate collaboration, and support future development.

## Detailed Description
This CIP proposes:
- Evaluating popular Ruby testing frameworks (e.g., RSpec, Minitest)
- Selecting the most appropriate framework for the project's needs
- Integrating the chosen framework into the codebase
- Establishing conventions for test organization, naming, and structure
- Adding initial example tests for key scripts (e.g., tidy_bib_unicode.rb)
- Documenting testing practices for contributors

## Implementation Plan
1. *Evaluate Testing Frameworks*
   - Compare RSpec, Minitest, and any other relevant options
   - Consider ease of use, community support, and compatibility

2. *Select and Integrate Framework*
   - Add the chosen framework as a dependency
   - Set up directory structure for tests (e.g., `spec/` or `test/`)
   - Configure test runner and helper files

3. *Establish Conventions and Add Example Tests*
   - Define naming and organization conventions
   - Write example tests for `tidy_bib_unicode.rb` and other core scripts
   - Ensure tests can be run easily (e.g., via `rake` or a simple command)

4. *Document Testing Practices*
   - Add documentation to the repository (e.g., in `README.md` or a dedicated file)
   - Provide guidance for contributors on writing and running tests

## Backward Compatibility
This change is additive and will not affect existing code. No changes are required for users who do not run tests.

## Testing Strategy
- The framework selection will be validated by running example tests
- Contributors will be encouraged to add tests for new features and bug fixes
- CI integration may be considered in the future
