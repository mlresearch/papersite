# CIP-0001: Unicode Tidying Preprocessing Step for BibTeX Files

## Summary
Introduce a preprocessing step in the PMLR pipeline that tidies BibTeX files by replacing all non-ASCII (Unicode) characters with user-supplied ASCII/LaTeX equivalents. This step will be performed before any BibTeX-to-YAML or detexing logic, ensuring that all downstream processing receives ASCII-only input.

## Motivation
- The current unicode replacement logic is embedded in mlresearch.rb and is applied during BibTeX-to-YAML conversion, making the code complex and error-prone.
- Ensuring BibTeX files are ASCII-only before further processing simplifies the pipeline, reduces edge cases, and improves maintainability.
- A standalone tidying script can be reused for any BibTeX file and ensures consistency across all volumes.

## Detailed Description
A new standalone script (e.g., `tidy_bib_unicode.rb` or `tidy_bib_unicode.py`) will:
- Read a `.bib` file.
- Scan all fields for non-ASCII (Unicode) characters.
- For each unique Unicode character, prompt the user for a replacement (using a YAML mapping file for suggestions).
- Apply the replacement throughout the file.
- Save the cleaned file (optionally as a new file, e.g., `uai2025_clean.bib`).
- Update the YAML mapping file for future runs.

This script will be run as a required preprocessing step before any BibTeX-to-YAML or detexing logic. The unicode replacement logic in the current mlresearch.rb will serve as a reference for the user prompt and mapping mechanism.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Draft the CIP**
   - Write and review the proposal for the new preprocessing step.
2. **Develop the tidying script**
   - Implement the script to scan, prompt, and replace Unicode in BibTeX files.
   - Use a YAML mapping file for persistent user suggestions.
3. **Test the script**
   - Run on sample BibTeX files and verify ASCII-only output.
   - Ensure mapping file is updated and reused.
4. **Update documentation and workflow**
   - Document the new preprocessing step and integrate it into the volume preparation workflow.
5. **Refactor mlresearch.rb**
   - Remove in-line unicode replacement logic once the preprocessing step is in place.

## Backward Compatibility
This change is backward compatible for downstream processing, as it only affects the preprocessing of BibTeX files. Users will need to run the tidying script before using the main pipeline.

## Testing Strategy
- Test the script on BibTeX files with known Unicode characters.
- Verify that all Unicode is replaced and the output is ASCII-only.
- Confirm that the mapping file is updated and reused across runs.
- Ensure that downstream YAML conversion and detexing work as expected with the cleaned files.
