title = {An efficient algorithm for contextual bandits with knapsacks, and an extension to concave objectives},
  pages     = {4-18},
abstract = {We consider a contextual version of multi-armed bandit problem with global knapsack constraints.
In each round, the outcome of pulling an arm is a scalar reward and a resource consumption vector,
both dependent on the context, and the global knapsack constraints require the total consumption for each resource to be below some pre-fixed budget. The learning agent competes with an arbitrary set of context-dependent policies. This problem was introduced by Badanidiyuru et al., who gave
a computationally inefficient algorithm with near-optimal regret bounds for it.  We give a \emph{computationally efficient} algorithm for this problem with slightly better regret bounds, by generalizing the approach of Dudik et al. for the non-constrained version of the problem. The computational time of our algorithm scales \emph{logarithmically} in the size of the policy space. This answers the main open question of Badanidiyuru et al.
We also extend our results to a variant where there are no knapsack constraints but the objective is an arbitrary Lipschitz concave function of the sum of outcome vectors. }

title = {Learning and Testing Junta Distributions},
  pages     = {19-46},
abstract = {
We consider the problem of learning distributions in the presence of irrelevant features. This problem is formalized by introducing a new notion of
\emph{$k$-junta distributions}.
Informally, a distribution $\mathcal{D}$ over the domain $\mathcal{X}^n$ is a
\emph{$k$-junta distribution} with respect to another distribution $\mathcal{U}$
over the same domain
if there is a set $J \subseteq [n]$ of size $|J| \le k$ that captures the difference between $\mathcal {D}$ and $\mathcal{U}$.

We show that it is possible to learn $k$-junta distributions with
respect to the uniform distribution over the Boolean hypercube $\{0,1\}^n$
in time $\poly(n^k, 1/\epsilon)$.
This result is obtained via a new Fourier-based learning
algorithm inspired by the Low-Degree Algorithm of
Linial, Mansour, and Nisan (1993).

We also consider the problem of testing whether an unknown distribution
is a $k$-junta distribution with respect to the uniform distribution.
We give a nearly-optimal algorithm for this task.
Both the analysis of the algorithm and the lower bound showing its optimality are obtained by establishing connections between the problem of testing junta distributions and testing uniformity of weighted collections of distributions.

title     = {Sign rank versus {VC} dimension},
  pages     = {47-80},
abstract  = {
This work studies the maximum
possible sign rank of $N \times N$ sign matrices with a given
VC dimension $d$.
For $d=1$, this maximum is {three}.
For $d=2$, this maximum is $\tilde{\Theta}(N^{1/2})$.
For $d >2$, similar but slightly less accurate statements hold.
Our lower bounds improve over previous ones
by Ben-David et al.~and can be interpreted as exhibiting
a weakness of kernel-based classifiers.
Our upper bounds, on the other hand,
can be interpreted as exhibiting the universality
of kernel-based classifiers.

The lower bounds are obtained by probabilistic constructions,
using a theorem of Warren in real algebraic topology.
The upper bounds are obtained using
a result of Welzl about spanning trees with low stabbing number,
and using the moment curve.

The upper bound technique is also used to:
(i) provide estimates on the number of classes
of a given VC dimension,
and the number of maximum
classes of a given VC dimension -- answering a question of Frankl from '89,
and (ii) design an efficient
algorithm that provides an $O(N/\log(N))$ multiplicative
approximation for the sign rank
(computing the sign rank is equivalent to the existential theory of the reals).


We also observe a general connection between sign rank
and spectral gaps which is based on Forster's argument.
Consider the $N \times N$ adjacency matrix of a $\Delta$ regular graph
with a second eigenvalue of absolute value $\lambda$ and
$\Delta \leq N/2$.
We show that the sign rank of the signed version of this matrix
is at least $\Delta/\lambda$.
We use this connection to prove the existence
of a maximum class $C\subseteq\{\pm 1\}^N$ with VC dimension $2$
and sign rank $\tilde{\Theta}(N^{1/2})$. This answers a question of
Ben-David et al.~regarding the sign rank of large VC classes.
We also describe limitations of this approach,
in the spirit of the Alon-Boppana theorem.

We further describe connections to communication complexity, geometry,
learning theory, and combinatorics.}

abstract = {Local search heuristics for non-convex optimizations are popular   in applied machine learning. However, in general it is  hard to  guarantee that such algorithms even  converge to a {\em local minimum}, due to the existence of complicated saddle point structures in high dimensions. Many functions have {\em degenerate} saddle points such that the first and second order derivatives cannot distinguish them with local optima.  In this paper we use higher order derivatives to escape these saddle points: we design the first efficient algorithm  guaranteed to converge to a third order local optimum (while existing techniques are at most second order). We also show that it is NP-hard to extend this further to finding fourth order local optima.}

In particular, we derive novel bounds on the loss of using a policy derived from a factored linear model, a class of models which generalize numerous previous models out of those that come with strong computational guarantees. For the first time in the literature, we derive performance bounds for model-based techniques where the model inaccuracy is measured in weighted norms. Moreover, our bounds show a decreased sensitivity to the discount factor and, unlike similar bounds derived for other approaches, they are insensitive to measure mismatch. Similarly to previous works, our proofs are also based on contraction arguments, but with the main differences that we use carefully constructed norms building on Banach lattices, and the contraction property is only assumed for operators acting on ``compressed'' spaces, thus weakening previous assumptions, while strengthening previous results.}

title = {Learning and 1-bit Compressed Sensing under Asymmetric Noise},
  pages     = {152-192},
abstract = {
We study the \emph{approximate recovery} problem: Given corrupted $1$-bit measurements of the form $sign(w^* \cdot x_i)$,
recover a vector $w$ that is a good approximation to $w^* \in \Re^d$.
This problem has been studied by both the learning theory and signal processing communities.
In learning theory, this is known as the problem of \emph{learning halfspaces with noise},
and in signal processing, as \emph{$1$-bit compressed sensing}, in which there is an additional assumption that $w^*$ is $t$-sparse.
The challenge in both cases is to design computationally efficient algorithms that are tolerant to large amounts of noise under realistic noise models.
Furthermore, in the case of 1-bit compressed sensing, we require  the number of measurements $x_i$ to scale polynomially in $t$ and
only polylogarithmically in $d$, the ambient dimension. In this work, we introduce algorithms with nearly optimal guarantees for both problems
under two realistic noise models, \emph{bounded (Massart) noise} and \emph{adversarial (agnostic) noise}, when the measurements
$x_i$'s are drawn from any isotropic log-concave distribution.

In bounded (Massart) noise, an adversary can flip the measurement of each point $x$ with probability $\eta(x)\leq \eta< 1/2$.
For this problem, we present an efficient algorithm that returns $w$ such that $\| w- w^*\|_2 \leq \epsilon$ in time $poly(d, \frac 1 \epsilon)$
for \emph{any} constant $\eta < 1/2$.  This improves significantly over the best known result of Awasthi et al. 2015, in this space that required the noise to be as small as $\eta\approx 10^{-6}$.
We then introduce an attribute-efficient variant of this algorithm for $1$-bit compressed sensing that achieves
the same guarantee with $poly(t, \log(d), \frac 1 {\epsilon})$ measurements when $\|w^*\|_0\leq t$.
For adversarial (agnostic) noise, where any $\nu$ fraction of measurements can be corrupted, we provide an algorithm that
returns $w$ such that $\|w-w^*\|_2 \leq O(\nu) + \epsilon$, with  $\tilde\Omega( \frac t {\epsilon^3}  \polylog(d))$  measurements. Our results improve on the best known approximation results in this space and under some regimes improve on the sample complexity of the existing results. Furthermore, this  is the first result of its kind in 1-bit compressed sensing
that goes beyond the Gaussian marginal distribution and works for any isotrpic log-concave distribution.}

While spectral methods have been previously employed for consistent learning of (passive) latent variable models such as hidden Markov models, POMDPs are more challenging  since the learner interacts with the environment and possibly changes the future observations in the process. We devise a learning algorithm running through episodes, in each episode we employ spectral techniques to learn the POMDP parameters from a trajectory generated by a fixed policy. At the end of the episode, an optimization oracle returns the optimal memoryless planning policy which maximizes the expected reward based on the estimated POMDP model. We prove an order-optimal regret bound w.r.t.\ the optimal memoryless policy and efficient scaling with respect to the dimensionality of observation and action spaces.}

In this paper we consider  convex optimization with noisy zero-th order information, that is noisy function evaluations at any desired point. We focus on problems with high degrees of smoothness, such as  logistic regression. We show that as opposed to gradient-based algorithms, high-order smoothness may be used to improve estimation rates, with a precise dependence  of our upper-bounds on the degree of smoothness. In particular, we show that for infinitely differentiable functions, we recover the same dependence on sample size as gradient-based algorithms, with an extra dimension-dependent factor. This is done for both convex and strongly-convex functions, with finite horizon and anytime algorithms. Finally, we also recover similar results in the online optimization setting.}

abstract = {We consider the \emph{noisy power method} algorithm, which has wide applications in machine learning and statistics, especially those related to principal component analysis (PCA) under resource (communication, memory or privacy) constraints. Existing analysis of the noisy power method shows an unsatisfactory dependency over the ``consecutive" spectral gap $(\sigma_k-\sigma_{k+1})$ of an input data matrix, which could be very small and hence limits the algorithm's applicability. In this paper, we present a new analysis of the noisy power method that achieves improved gap dependency for both sample complexity and noise tolerance bounds. More specifically, we improve the dependency over $(\sigma_k-\sigma_{k+1})$ to dependency over $(\sigma_k-\sigma_{q+1})$, where $q$ is an intermediate algorithm parameter and could be much larger than the target rank $k$. Our proofs are built upon a novel characterization of proximity between two subspaces that differ from canonical angle characterizations
analyzed in previous works. Finally, we apply our improved bounds to distributed private PCA and memory-efficient streaming PCA and obtain bounds that are superior to existing results in the literature.}

  pages     = {310-335},
abstract={A large body of work in machine learning has focused
on the problem of learning a close approximation to an underlying combinatorial function,
given a small set of labeled examples.
However, for real-valued functions, cardinal labels might not be accessible, or it may be difficult for an expert to
consistently assign real-valued labels over the entire set of examples. For instance, it is
notoriously hard for consumers to reliably assign values to bundles of merchandise.
Instead, it might be much easier for a consumer to report which of two bundles she likes better.

With this motivation in mind, we consider an alternative learning model, wherein the algorithm must learn the underlying function up to pairwise comparisons, from pairwise comparisons. In this model, we present a series of novel algorithms that learn over a wide variety of combinatorial function classes. These range from graph functions to broad classes of valuation functions that are fundamentally important in microeconomic theory, the analysis of social networks, and machine learning, such as coverage, submodular, XOS, and subadditive functions, as well as functions with sparse Fourier support.}

In this general setting, the best known algorithms achieve regret O(\sqrt{KT}) in T rounds with K actions. In this paper, we present the first instance-dependent regret bounds for the general problem, focusing particularly on when the von Neumann winner is sparse. Specifically, we propose a new algorithm whose regret, relative to a unique von Neumann winner with sparsity s, is at most O(\sqrt{sT}), plus an instance-dependent constant. Thus, when the sparsity is much smaller than the total number of actions, our result indicates that learning can be substantially faster.}

symmetric stochastic block model with $q$ groups, average degree $d$, and
connection probabilities $c_{\mathrm{in}}/n$ and $c_{\mathrm{out}}/n$ for within-group and
between-group edges respectively; let $\lambda = (c_{\mathrm{in}}-c_{\mathrm{out}})/(qd)$.  We
show that, when $q$ is large, and $\lambda = O(1/q)$, the critical value of $d$
at which community detection becomes possible---in physical terms, the
condensation threshold---is
$$
d_{\mathrm{c}} = \Theta\left( \frac{\log q}{q \lambda^2} \right) \, ,
$$
with tighter results in certain regimes.  Above this threshold, we show that
any partition of the nodes into $q$ groups which is as `good' as the planted one,
in terms of the number of within- and between-group edges, is correlated with it.
This gives an exponential-time algorithm that performs better than chance;
specifically, community detection becomes possible below the Kesten-Stigum bound
for $q \ge 5$ in the disassortative case $\lambda < 0$, and for $q \ge 11$ in the
assortative case $\lambda > 0$
(similar upper bounds were obtained independently by Abbe and Sandon).
Conversely, below this threshold, we show that no algorithm can label the vertices better
than chance, or even distinguish the block model from an Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph with
high probability.

Our lower bound on $d_{\mathrm{c}}$ uses Robinson and Wormald's small subgraph conditioning method,
and we also give (less explicit) results for non-symmetric stochastic block
models.  In the symmetric case, we obtain explicit results by using bounds
on certain functions of doubly stochastic matrices due to Achlioptas and Naor;
indeed, our lower bound on $d_{\mathrm{c}}$ is their second moment lower bound on the
$q$-colorability threshold for random graphs with a certain effective
degree.}

We assume that $T$ is entry-wise close to being rank $r$. Our goal is to fill in its missing entries using as few observations as possible. Let $n = \max(n_1, n_2, n_3)$. We show that if
$m =  n^{3/2} r$ then there is a polynomial time algorithm based on the sixth level of the sum-of-squares hierarchy for completing it. Our estimate agrees with almost all of $T$'s entries almost exactly and works even when our observations are corrupted by noise. This is also the first algorithm for tensor completion that works in the overcomplete case when $r > n$, and in fact it works all the way up to $r = n^{3/2-\epsilon}$.

Our proofs are short and simple and are based on establishing a new connection between noisy tensor completion (through the language of Rademacher complexity) and the task of refuting random constant satisfaction problems. This connection seems to have gone unnoticed even in the context of matrix completion. Furthermore, we use this connection to show matching lower bounds. Our main technical result is in characterizing the Rademacher complexity of the sequence of norms that arise in the sum-of-squares relaxations to the tensor nuclear norm.  These results point to an interesting new direction: Can we explore computational vs. sample complexity tradeoffs through the sum-of-squares hierarchy?}

These include  symmetric matrix eigendecomposition, certain tensor decompositions, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), spectral clustering and Gaussian mixture learning. Each of these problems reduces to an instance of our general model, which we call a ``Basis Encoding Function" (BEF). We show that learning a basis within this model can then be provably and efficiently achieved using a first order  iteration algorithm (gradient iteration). Our algorithm goes beyond tensor methods while generalizing a number of existing algorithms---e.g., the power method for symmetric matrices, the tensor power iteration for orthogonal decomposable tensors, and cumulant-based FastICA---all within a broader function-based dynamical systems framework. Our framework also unifies the unusual phenomenon observed in these domains that they can be solved using efficient non-convex optimization. Specifically, we describe a class of BEFs such that their local maxima on the unit sphere are in one-to-one correspondence with the basis elements. This description relies on a certain ``hidden convexity" property of these functions.

We provide a complete theoretical analysis of the gradient iteration even when the BEF is perturbed. We show convergence and complexity bounds polynomial in dimension and other relevant parameters, such as perturbation size. Our perturbation results can be considered as a  non-linear version of the classical Davis-Kahan theorem for perturbations of eigenvectors of symmetric matrices. In addition we show that   our algorithm exhibits fast (superlinear) convergence and relate the speed of convergence to the properties of the BEF. Moreover, the gradient iteration algorithm can be easily and efficiently implemented in practice.}

In addition, we provide a procedure to initialize \textsc{Fgd} for (restricted) strongly convex objectives and when one only has access to $f$ via a first-order oracle; for several problem instances, such proper initialization leads to \emph{global} convergence guarantees.

\textsc{Fgd} and similar procedures are widely used in practice for problems that can be posed as matrix factorization.

We study networks of communicating learning agents that cooperate to solve a common nonstochastic bandit problem. Agents use an underlying communication network to get messages about actions selected by other agents, and drop messages that took more than $d$ hops to arrive, where $d$ is a delay parameter. We introduce Exp3-Coop, a cooperative version of the Exp3 algorithm and prove that with $K$ actions and $N$ agents the average per-agent regret after $T$ rounds is at most of order $\sqrt{\left(d+1 + \frac{K}{N}\alpha_{\leq d}\right)(T\ln K)}$, where $\alpha_{\leq d}$ is the independence number of the $d$-th power of the communication graph $G$. We then show that for any connected graph, for $d=\sqrt{K}$ the regret bound is $K^{1/4}\sqrt{T}$, strictly better than the minimax regret $\sqrt{KT}$ for noncooperating agents. More informed choices of $d$ lead to bounds which are arbitrarily close to the full information minimax regret $\sqrt{T\ln K}$ when $G$ is dense. When $G$ has sparse components, we show that a variant of Exp3-Coop, allowing agents to choose their parameters according to their centrality in $G$, strictly improves the regret. Finally, as a by-product of our analysis, we provide the first characterization of the minimax regret for bandit learning with delay.

abstract  = {Reputation and reliability play a central role in a wide range of applications, from online marketplaces to review aggregators to ridesharing services.  Many reputation systems are vulnerable to manipulation, and protected only by keeping algorithms secret, avoiding high-stakes applications, or using side information to identify malicious users.  The current situation is reminiscent of pre-modern cryptography, characterized by a patchwork of ad hoc techniques with minimal formal understanding of their security.

We propose a reputation system which provably achieves a very strong correctness guarantee under extremely pessimistic assumptions---it works even given a supermajority of malicious users, converges to optimal behavior after a constant number of interactions per user, does not require repeated interactions, and accommodates time-varying quality of resources.

Our formal model is simple but general.  In each period, a user is given an opportunity to interact with a resource, and must accept or reject the proposed interaction.  If they accept, they receive a payoff in $[-1, 1]$.  Ideally all users would behave honestly, pooling their data and quickly learning which resources are worth interacting with.  Our protocol essentially matches this performance when all users are honest, while guaranteeing that adding malicious users or users with varying tastes does very little damage.

We also extend our results to a more challenging setting where users interact with each other rather than with static resources, and where the two parties to an interaction may receive different payoffs.

abstract = {It has long been conjectured that hypotheses spaces suitable for data that is compositional in nature, such as text or images, may be more efficiently represented with deep hierarchical networks than with shallow ones. Despite the vast empirical evidence supporting this belief, theoretical justifications to date are limited. In particular, they do not account for the locality, sharing and pooling constructs of convolutional networks, the most successful deep learning architecture to date. In this work we derive a deep network architecture based on arithmetic circuits that inherently employs locality, sharing and pooling. An equivalence between the networks and hierarchical tensor factorizations is established. We show that a shallow network corresponds to CP (rank-1) decomposition, whereas a deep network corresponds to Hierarchical Tucker decomposition. Using tools from measure theory and matrix algebra, we prove that besides a negligible set, all functions that can be implemented by a deep network of polynomial size, require exponential size in order to be realized (or even approximated) by a shallow network. Since log-space computation transforms our networks into SimNets, the result applies directly to a deep learning architecture demonstrating promising empirical performance. The construction and theory developed in this paper shed new light on various practices and ideas employed by the deep learning community.}

recently been noted [Dwork et al. 2015], even if
several algorithms have this guarantee in isolation,
the guarantee need not hold if the algorithms are
composed adaptively. In this paper, we study three
notions of generalization---increasing in
strength---that are \emph{robust} to postprocessing
and amenable to adaptive composition, and examine
the relationships between them.  We call the weakest
such notion \emph{Robust Generalization}. A second,
intermediate, notion is the stability guarantee
known as \emph{differential privacy}. The strongest
guarantee we consider we call \emph{Perfect
Generalization}. We prove that every hypothesis
class that is PAC learnable is also PAC learnable in
a robustly generalizing fashion, with almost the
same sample complexity. It was previously known that
differentially private algorithms satisfy robust
generalization. In this paper, we show that robust
generalization is a strictly weaker concept, and
that there is a learning task that can be carried
out subject to robust generalization guarantees, yet
cannot be carried out subject to differential
privacy. We also show that perfect generalization is
a strictly stronger guarantee than differential

for Sums of Independent Integer Random Variables},
  pages     = {831-849},
abstract = {We study the structure and learnability of sums of independent integer random variables (SIIRVs).
For $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}$, a {\em$k$-SIIRV of order $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}$} is the probability distribution of the sum of $n$
mutually independent random variables each supported on $\{0, 1, \dots, k-1\}$.
We denote by ${\cal S}_{n,k}$ the set of all $k$-SIIRVs of order $n$.

How many samples are required to learn an arbitrary distribution in ${\cal S}_{n,k}$?
In this paper, we tightly characterize the sample and computational complexity of this problem.
More precisely, we design a computationally efficient algorithm that uses $\widetilde{O}(k/\epsilon^2)$ samples,
and learns an arbitrary $k$-SIIRV within error $\epsilon,$ in total variation distance. Moreover, we show that
the {\em optimal} sample complexity of this learning problem is
$\Theta((k/\epsilon^2)\sqrt{\log(1/\epsilon)}),$ i.e., we prove an upper bound and a matching
information-theoretic lower bound.
Our algorithm proceeds by learning the Fourier transform of the target $k$-SIIRV in its effective support.
Its correctness relies on the {\em approximate sparsity} of the Fourier transform of $k$-SIIRVs --
a structural property that we establish, roughly stating that the Fourier transform of $k$-SIIRVs
has small magnitude outside a small set.

Along the way we prove several new structural results about $k$-SIIRVs.
As one of our main structural contributions, we give an efficient algorithm to construct a
sparse {\em proper} $\epsilon$-cover for ${\cal S}_{n,k},$ in total variation distance.
We also obtain a novel geometric characterization of the space of $k$-SIIRVs. Our
characterization allows us to prove a tight lower bound on the size of $\epsilon$-covers for ${\cal S}_{n,k}$
-- establishing that our cover upper bound is optimal -- and is the key ingredient in our tight sample complexity lower bound.

Our approach of exploiting the sparsity of the Fourier transform in
distribution learning is general, and has recently found additional applications.
In a subsequent work, we use a generalization of this idea
to obtain the first computationally efficient learning algorithm for Poisson multinomial distributions.
In~a separate work, we build on our Fourier-based approach to obtain the fastest known proper learning algorithm
for Poisson binomial distributions ($2$-SIIRVs).

  pages     = {850-878},
abstract = {We give an algorithm for properly learning Poisson binomial distributions.
A Poisson binomial distribution (PBD) of order $n \in \mathbb{Z}_+$
is the discrete probability distribution of the sum of $n$ mutually independent Bernoulli random variables.
Given $\widetilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ samples from an unknown PBD $P$, our algorithm runs in time
$(1/\eps)^{O(\log \log (1/\epsilon))}$, and outputs a hypothesis PBD that is $\epsilon$-close to $P$ in total variation distance.
The sample complexity of our algorithm is known to be nearly-optimal, up to logarithmic factors, as established
in previous work. However, the previously best known running time for properly
learning PBDs was $(1/\epsilon)^{O(\log(1/\epsilon))}$, and was essentially obtained by
enumeration over an appropriate  $\epsilon$-cover. We remark that the running time of this cover-based approach cannot be
improved, as any $\epsilon$-cover for the space of PBDs has size  $(1/\epsilon)^{\Omega(\log(1/\epsilon))}$.

As one of our main contributions, we provide a novel structural characterization of PBDs,
showing that any PBD $P$ is $\epsilon$-close to another PBD $Q$ with $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ distinct parameters.
More precisely, we prove that, for all $\epsilon >0,$ there exists
an explicit collection $\cal{M}$ of $(1/\epsilon)^{O(\log \log (1/\epsilon))}$ vectors of multiplicities,
such that for any PBD $P$ there exists a PBD $Q$ with $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ distinct parameters whose multiplicities are given by some element of ${\cal M}$,
such that $Q$ is $\epsilon$-close to $P.$  Our proof combines tools from Fourier analysis and algebraic geometry.


Our approach to the proper learning problem is as follows:
Starting with an accurate non-proper hypothesis, we fit a PBD to this hypothesis.
This fitting problem can be formulated as a natural polynomial optimization problem.
Our aforementioned structural characterization allows
us to reduce the corresponding fitting problem
to a collection of $(1/\epsilon)^{O(\log \log(1/\epsilon))}$
systems of low-degree polynomial inequalities.
We show that each such system can be solved in time $(1/\epsilon)^{O(\log \log(1/\epsilon))}$,
which yields the overall running time of our algorithm.

regression problem in a semi-supervised setting, where one observes
$n$ labeled vertices, and the task is to label the remaining

regularization under a $d$-dimensional geometric random graph model.
We provide a variational characterization of the performance of this
regularized learner as $N$ grows to infinity while $n$
stays constant; the associated optimality conditions lead to a partial
differential equation that must be satisfied by the associated
function estimate $\widehat{f}$.  From this formulation we derive several
predictions on the limiting behavior the function
$\fhat$, including (a) a phase transition in its smoothness at the
threshold $p = d + 1$; and (b) a tradeoff between smoothness and
sensitivity to the underlying unlabeled data distribution $P$.  Thus,
over the range $p \leq d$, the function estimate $\widehat{f}$ is degenerate
and ``spiky,'' whereas for $p\geq d+1$, the function estimate $\fhat$
is smooth.  We show that the effect of the underlying density vanishes
monotonically with $p$, such that in the limit $p = \infty$,
corresponding to the so-called Absolutely Minimal Lipschitz Extension,
the estimate $\widehat{f}$ is independent of the distribution $P$. Under the
assumption of semi-supervised smoothness, ignoring $P$ can lead to
poor statistical performance; in particular, we construct a specific
example for $d=1$ to demonstrate that $p=2$ has lower risk than
$p=\infty$ due to the former penalty adapting to $P$ and the latter
ignoring it.  We also provide simulations that verify the accuracy of
our predictions for finite sample sizes.  Together, these properties
show that $p = d+1$ is an optimal choice, yielding a function estimate
$\fhat$ that is both smooth and non-degenerate, while remaining
maximally sensitive to $P$.

When $|V_2| \gg |V_1|$, multiple thresholds emerge.  We first locate a sharp threshold for detection of the partition, in the sense of the results of Mossel, Neeman and Sly and  Massoulie for the stochastic block model.  We then show that at a higher edge density, the singular vectors of the rectangular biadjacency matrix exhibit a localization / delocalization phase transition, giving recovery above the threshold and no recovery below.  Nevertheless, we propose a simple spectral algorithm,  Diagonal Deletion SVD, which recovers the partition at a nearly optimal edge density.

The bipartite stochastic block model studied here was used by Feldman, Perkins, Vempala to give a unified algorithm for recovering planted partitions and assignments in random hypergraphs and random $k$-SAT formulae respectively.  Our results give the best known bounds for the clause density at which solutions can be found efficiently in these models as well as showing a barrier to further improvement via this reduction to the bipartite block model.}

suboptimal by a constant factor; (3) If $K=o(n/\log n)$ and $K \to \infty$, SDP is order-wise suboptimal.
The same critical scaling for $K$ is found to hold, up to constant factors, for the performance of SDP on the stochastic block model of $n$ vertices partitioned into multiple communities of equal size $K$. A key ingredient in the proof of the necessary condition is a construction of a primal feasible solution based on

The algorithm nearly matches (and in certain cases improves upon) the accuracy obtained by the standard batch method that computes top eigenvector of the empirical covariance $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i \in [n]} A_i$ as analyzed by the matrix Bernstein inequality. Moreover, to achieve constant accuracy, our algorithm improves upon the best previous known sample complexities of streaming algorithms by either a multiplicative factor of $O(d)$ or $1/\mathrm{gap}$ where $\mathrm{gap}$ is the relative distance between the top two eigenvalues of $\Sigma$.

We achieve these results through a novel analysis of the classic Oja's algorithm, one of the oldest and perhaps, most popular algorithms for streaming PCA. We show that simply picking a random initial point $w_0$ and applying the natural update rule $w_{i + 1} = w_i + \eta_i A_i w_i$ suffices for suitable choice of $\eta_i$.

Many algorithms exist for learning communities in the Stochastic Block Model, but they do not work well in the presence of errors.

In this paper, we initiate the study of robust algorithms for partial recovery in SBM with modeling errors or noise.
We consider graphs generated according to the Stochastic Block Model and then modified by an adversary. We allow two types of adversarial errors,
Feige---Kilian or monotone errors, and edge outlier errors. Mossel, Neeman and Sly (STOC 2015) posed an open question about whether an almost exact recovery is possible when the adversary is allowed to add $o(n)$ edges. Our work answers this question affirmatively even in the case of $k>2$ communities.

We then show that our algorithms work not only when the instances come from SBM, but also work when the instances come from
any distribution of graphs that is $\varepsilon m$ close to SBM in the Kullback---Leibler divergence.
This result also works in the presence of adversarial errors. Finally, we present almost tight lower bounds for two communities.

An inspection by an expert produces a noisy outcome that depends both on the job's hidden label and the type of the expert, and occupies the expert for a finite time duration. A decision maker's task is to dynamically assign inspections so that the resulting outcomes can be used to accurately recover the labels of all jobs, while keeping the system stable. Among our chief motivations are applications in crowd-sourcing, diagnostics, and experiment designs, where one wishes to efficiently discover the nature of a large number of items, using a finite pool of computational resources or human agents.

We focus on the \emph{capacity} of such an information processing system. Given a level of accuracy guarantee, we ask how many experts are needed in order to stabilize the system, and through what inspection architecture. Our main result provides an adaptive inspection policy that is asymptotically optimal in the following sense: the ratio between the required number of experts under our policy and the theoretical optimal converges to one, as the probability of error in label recovery tends to zero.}

title     = {Learning Simple Auctions},
  pages     = {1298-1318},
abstract  = { We present a general framework for proving
polynomial sample complexity bounds for the problem
of learning from samples the best auction in a class
of ``simple'' auctions.  Our framework captures the
most prominent examples of ``simple'' auctions,
including anonymous and non-anonymous item and
bundle pricings, with either a single or multiple
buyers.  The first step of the framework is to show
that the set of auction allocation rules have a
low-dimensional representation.  The second step
shows that, across the subset of auctions that share
the same allocations on a given set of samples, the
auction revenue varies in a low-dimensional way.
Our results effectively imply that whenever it is
possible to compute a near-optimal simple auction
with a known prior, it is also possible to compute
such an auction with an unknown prior, given a
polynomial number of samples. }}

title = {Density Evolution in the
Degree-correlated Stochastic Block Model},
  pages     = {1319-1356},
abstract = {
There is a recent surge of interest in identifying the sharp recovery thresholds for cluster recovery under the
stochastic block model. In this paper, we address the more refined question of how many vertices that will be misclassified
on average. We consider the binary form of the stochastic block model,
where $n$ vertices are partitioned into  two clusters
with edge probability
$a/n$ within the first cluster, $c/n$ within the second cluster, and
$b/n$ across clusters.  Suppose that as $n \to \infty$,
$a= b+ \mu \sqrt{ b} $,  $c=b+  \nu \sqrt{ b} $ for two fixed
constants $\mu, \nu$, and $b \to \infty$ with $b=n^{o(1)}$.
When the cluster sizes are balanced and $\mu \neq \nu$,
we show that
the minimum fraction of misclassified vertices on average is given by  $Q(\sqrt{v^*})$,
where $Q(x)$ is the Q-function for standard normal,
$v^*$ is the unique fixed point of $v= \frac{(\mu-\nu)^2}{16} + \frac{ (\mu+\nu)^2 }{16} \mathbb{E}[ \tanh(v+ \sqrt{v} Z)]$,
and $Z$ is standard normal. Moreover, the minimum  misclassified  fraction on average is attained by a local algorithm, namely
belief propagation, in time linear in the number of edges. Our proof techniques are based on connecting the cluster recovery problem to
tree reconstruction problems, and analyzing the density evolution of belief propagation on trees with Gaussian approximations.

  pages     = {1357-1375},
abstract = {We study Boolean functions of an arbitrary number of input variables that can be realized by simple iterative constructions based on constant-size primitives. This restricted type of construction needs little global coordination or control and thus is a candidate for neurally feasible computation. Valiant's construction of a majority function can be realized in this manner and, as we show, can be generalized to any uniform threshold function. We study the rate of convergence, finding that while linear convergence to the correct function can be achieved for any threshold using a fixed set of primitives, for quadratic convergence, the size of the primitives must grow as the threshold approaches $0$ or $1$. We also study finite realizations of this process and the learnability of the functions realized. We show that the constructions realized are accurate outside a small interval near the target threshold, where the size of the construction grows as the inverse square of the interval width. This phenomenon, that errors are higher closer to thresholds (and thresholds closer to the boundary are harder to represent), is a well-known cognitive finding.}

comparisons is a ubiquitous problem and has been studied in disciplines
ranging from statistics to operations research and from theoretical computer
science to machine learning. Here we consider a general setting where
outcomes of pairwise comparisons between items $i$ and $j$ are drawn
probabilistically by flipping a coin with unknown bias $P_{ij}$ , and ask under
what conditions on these unknown probabilities one can learn a good ranking
from comparisons of only $O(n\log(n))$ non-actively chosen pairs. Recent work has
established this is possible under the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) and noisy
permutation (NP) models. Here we introduce a broad family of ‘low-rank’
conditions on the probabilities $P_{ij}$ under which the resulting preference
matrix $P$ has low rank under some link function, and show these conditions
encompass the BTL and Thurstone classes as special cases, but are
considerably more general. We then give a new algorithm called low-rank
pairwise ranking (LRPR) which provably learns a good ranking from comparisons
of only $O(n\log(n))$ randomly chosen comparisons under such low-rank models. Our
algorithm and analysis make use of tools from the theory of low-rank matrix
completion, and provide a new perspective on the problem of ranking from
pairwise comparisons in non-active settings.}

  pages     = {1402-1416},
abstract = {We consider the problem of approximating partition functions for Ising models. We make use of recent tools in combinatorial optimization: the Sherali-Adams and Lasserre convex programming hierarchies, in combination with variational methods to get algorithms for calculating partition functions in these families. These techniques give new, non-trivial approximation guarantees for the partition function beyond the regime of correlation decay. They also generalize some classical results from statistical physics about the Curie-Weiss ferromagnetic Ising model, as well as provide a partition function counterpart of classical results about max-cut on dense graphs (Arora, 1995). With this, we connect techniques from two apparently disparate research areas -- optimization and counting/partition function approximations. (i.e. \#-P type of problems).

Furthermore, we design to the best of our knowledge the first provable, convex variational methods. Though in the literature there are a host of convex versions of variational methods, they come with no guarantees (apart from some extremely special cases, like e.g. the graph has a single cycle). We consider dense and low rank graphs, and interestingly, the reason our approach works on these types of graphs is because local correlations propagate to global correlations -- completely the opposite of algorithms based on correlation decay. In the process we design novel entropy approximations based on the low-order moments of a distribution.

Our proof techniques are very simple and generic, and likely to be applicable to many other settings other than Ising models. }

  pages     = {1417-1418},
abstract = {This paper considers the optimal adaptive allocation of measurement effort for identifying the best among a finite set of options or designs.  An experimenter sequentially chooses designs to measure and observes noisy signals of their quality with the goal of confidently identifying the best design  after a small number of measurements. I propose three simple Bayesian algorithms for adaptively allocating measurement effort. One is Top-Two Probability sampling, which computes the two designs with the highest posterior probability of being optimal, and then randomizes to select among these two. One is a variant a top-two sampling which considers not only the probability a design is optimal, but the expected amount by which its quality exceeds that of other designs. The final algorithm is a modified version of Thompson sampling that is tailored for identifying the best design. I prove that these simple algorithms satisfy a strong optimality property. In a frequestist setting where the true quality of the designs is fixed, one hopes the posterior definitively identifies the optimal design, in the sense that that the posterior probability assigned to the event that some other design is optimal converges to zero as measurements are collected. I show that under the proposed algorithms this convergence occurs at an \emph{exponential rate}, and the corresponding exponent is the best possible among all allocation rules.}

Pool-based algorithms can select elements at any order, while stream-based algorithms observe elements in sequence, and can only select elements immediately after observing them. We assume that the suggested elements are generated independently from some source distribution, and ask what is the stream size required for emulating a pool algorithm with a given pool size. We provide algorithms and matching lower bounds for general pool algorithms, and for utility-based pool algorithms. We further show that a maximal gap between the two settings exists also in the special case of active learning for binary classification.}

The objective is to identify the subset that achieves the highest expected reward with high probability using as few queries as possible. We present distribution-dependent lower bounds based on a particular construction which force a learner to consider all N-choose-K subsets, and match naive extensions of known upper bounds in the bandit setting obtained by treating each subset as a separate arm. Nevertheless, we present evidence that exhaustive search may be avoided for certain, favorable distributions because the influence of high-order order correlations may be dominated by lower order statistics. Finally, we present an algorithm and analysis for independent arms, which mitigates the surprising non-trivial information occlusion that occurs due to only observing the max in the subset. This may inform strategies for more general dependent measures, and we complement these result with independent-arm lower bounds. }

abstract = {Motivated by online advertising auctions, we consider repeated Vickrey auctions where goods of unknown value are sold sequentially and bidders only learn (potentially noisy) information about a good's value once it is purchased. We adopt an online learning approach with bandit feedback to  model this problem and derive bidding strategies for two models: stochastic and adversarial. In the stochastic model, the observed values of the goods are  random variables centered around the true value of the good. In this case, logarithmic regret is achievable when competing against well behaved adversaries. In the adversarial model, the goods need not be identical. Comparing our performance against that of the best fixed bid in hindsight, we show that sublinear regret is also achievable in this case. For both the stochastic and adversarial models, we prove matching minimax lower bounds showing our strategies to be optimal up to lower-order terms. To our knowledge, this is the first complete set of strategies for bidders participating in auctions of this type.},

In this setting, examples arrive sequentially, the learner is given a hypothesis class $\mathcal{H}$, and the goal of the learner is to either predict a label on each example or abstain, while ensuring that it does not make more than a pre-specified number of mistakes when it does predict a label.

Previous work on this problem has left open two main challenges. First, not much is known about the optimality of algorithms, and in particular, about what an optimal algorithmic strategy is for any individual hypothesis class. Second, while the realizable case has been studied, the more realistic non-realizable scenario is not well-understood. In this paper, we address both challenges. First, we provide a novel measure, called the Extended Littlestone's Dimension, which captures the number of abstentions needed to ensure a certain number of mistakes. Second, we explore the non-realizable case, and provide upper and lower bounds on the number of abstentions required by an algorithm to guarantee a specified number of mistakes.}

  pages     = {1639-1642},
abstract  = {Planning plays an important role in the broad class of decision theory. Planning has drawn much attention in recent work in the robotics and sequential decision making areas. Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL), as an agent-environment interaction problem, has brought further attention to planning methods. Generally in RL, one can assume a generative model, e.g. graphical models, for the environment, and then the task for the RL agent is to learn the model parameters and find the optimal strategy based on these learnt parameters. Based on environment behavior, the agent can assume various types of generative models, e.g. Multi Armed Bandit for a static environment, or Markov Decision Process (MDP) for a dynamic environment. The advantage of these popular models is their simplicity, which results in tractable methods of learning the parameters and finding the optimal policy. The drawback of these models is again their simplicity: these models usually underfit and underestimate the actual environment behavior. For example, in robotics, the agent usually has noisy observations of the environment inner state and MDP is not a suitable model.

More complex models like Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) can compensate for this drawback. Fitting this model to the environment, where the partial observation is given to the agent, generally gives dramatic performance improvement, sometimes unbounded improvement, compared to MDP. In general, finding the optimal policy for the POMDP model is computationally intractable and fully non convex, even for the class of memoryless policies. The open problem is to come up with a method to find an exact or an approximate optimal stochastic memoryless policy for POMDP models.}

problem in stochastic multi-armed bandits.

However, we do not yet have a complete understanding of the
optimal sample complexity of the problem:
The state-of-the-art algorithms achieve a sample complexity
of $O(\sum_{i=2}^{n} \Delta_{i}^{-2}(\ln\delta^{-1} + \ln\ln\Delta_i^{-1}))$
($\Delta_{i}$ is the difference between the largest mean and the $i^{th}$ mean), while the best known lower bound is $\Omega(\sum_{i=2}^{n} \Delta_{i}^{-2}\ln\delta^{-1})$ for general instances and $\Omega(\Delta^{-2} \ln\ln \Delta^{-1})$ for the two-arm instances.
We propose to study the instance-wise optimality for the BEST-1-ARM problem.
Previous work has proved that it is impossible to have an instance optimal
algorithm for the 2-arm problem.
However, we conjecture that modulo the additive term
$\Omega(\Delta_2^{-2} \ln\ln \Delta_2^{-1})$ (which is an upper bound and worst case lower bound for the 2-arm problem),
there is an instance optimal algorithm for BEST-1-ARM.
Moreover, we introduce a new quantity, called the gap entropy for a best-arm problem instance, and conjecture that it is the instance-wise lower bound.
Hence, resolving this conjecture would provide a final answer
to the old and basic problem.}
