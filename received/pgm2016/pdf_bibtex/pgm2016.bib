abstract = {We propose a regime aware learning algorithm to learn a sequence of Bayesian networks (BNs) that model a system that undergoes {\it regime} changes. The last BN in the sequence represents the system's current regime, and should be used for BN inference. To explore the feasibility of the algorithm, we create baseline tests against learning a singe BN, and show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the single BN approach. We also apply the learning algorithm on real world data from the financial domain, where it is evident that the algorithm is able to produce BNs that have adapted to the regime changes during the most recent global financial crisis of 2007-08.},

title = {Learning Tractable Multidimensional {B}ayesian Network Classifiers},
author = {Benjumeda, Marco and Bielza, Concha and Larra{\~n}aga, Pedro},
pages = {13-24},
abstract = {Multidimensional classification has become one of the most relevant topics in view of the many domains that require a vector of class values to be assigned to a vector of given features. The popularity of multidimensional Bayesian network classifiers has increased in the last few years due to their expressive power and the existence of methods for learning different families of these models. The problem with this approach is that the computational cost of using the learned models is usually high, especially if there are a lot of class variables. Class-bridge decomposability means that the multidimensional classification problem can be divided into multiple subproblems for these models. In this paper, we prove that class-bridge decomposability can also be used to guarantee the tractability of the models. We also propose a strategy for efficiently bounding their inference complexity, providing a simple learning method with an order-based search that obtains tractable multidimensional Bayesian network classifiers. Experimental results show that our approach is competitive with other methods in the state of the art and ensures the tractability of the learned models.},

title = {{B}ayesian Networks: a Combined Tuning Heuristic},
author = {Bolt, Janneke H.},
pages = {37-49},
abstract = {One of the issues in tuning an output probability of a Bayesian network by changing multiple parameters is the relative amount of the individual parameter changes. In an existing heuristic parameters are tied such that their changes induce locally a maximal change of the tuned probability. This heuristic, however, may reduce the attainable values of the tuned probability considerably. In another existing heuristic parameters are tied such that they simultaneously change in the entire interval $\langle 0,1\rangle$. The tuning range of this heuristic will in general be larger then the tuning range of the locally optimal heuristic. Disadvantage, however, is that knowledge of the local optimal change is not exploited. In this paper a heuristic is proposed that is locally optimal, yet covers the larger tuning range of the second heuristic. Preliminary experiments show that this heuristic is a promising alternative.},

pages = {50-61},
abstract = {In many problems involving multivariate time series, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are often employed to model complex behavior over time. HMMs can, however, require large number of states, that can lead to overfitting issues especially when limited data is available. In this work, we propose a family of models called Asymmetric Hidden Markov Models (HMM-As), that generalize the emission distributions to arbitrary Bayesian-network distributions. The new model allows for state-specific graphical structures defined over the space of observable features, what renders more compact state spaces and hence a better handling of the complexity-overfitting trade-off. We first define asymmetric HMMs, followed by the definition of a learning procedure inspired on the structural expectation-maximization framework allowing for decomposing learning per state. Then, we relate representation aspects of HMM-As to standard and independent HMMs. The last contribution of the paper is a set of experiments that elucidate the behavior of asymmetric HMMs on practical scenarios, including simulations and industry-based scenarios. The empirical results indicate that HMMs are limited when learning structured distributions, what is prevented by the more parsimonious representation of HMM-As. Furthermore, HMM-As showed to be promising in uncovering multiple graphical structures and providing better model fit in a case study from the domain of large-scale printers, thus providing additional problem insight.},

Conceptually, these credal networks are elegant and useful. However, in practice, they have long remained very hard to work with, both theoretically and computationally. This paper provides a general introduction to this type of credal networks and presents some promising new theoretical developments that were recently proved using sets of desirable gambles and lower previsions. We explain these developments in terms of probabilities and expectations, thereby making them more easily accessible to the Bayesian network community.},

abstract = {Statistical matching (also known as data fusion, data merging, or data integration) is the umbrella term for a collection of methods which serve to combine different data sources. The objective is to obtain joint information about variables which have not jointly been collected in one survey, but on two (or more) surveys with disjoint sets of observation units. Besides specific variables for the different data files, it is indispensable to have common variables which are observed in both data sets and on basis of which the matching can be performed. Several existing statistical matching approaches are based on the assumption of conditional independence of the specific variables given the common variables. Relying on the well-known fact that d-separation is related to conditional independence for a probability distribution which factorizes along a directed acyclic graph, we suggest to use probabilistic graphical models as a powerful tool for statistical matching. In this paper, we describe and discuss first attempts for statistical matching of discrete data by Bayesian networks. The approach is exemplarily applied to data collected within the scope of the German General Social Survey.},

Staged trees generalise modelling techniques established for Bayesian networks (BN).

Conveniently, what we call the interpolating polynomial of a staged tree has been found to be an analogue to the essential graph of a BN. By analysing this polynomial in a differential framework, we find that interventions on the model can be expressed as a very simple operation. We can therefore clearly state causal hypotheses which are invariant for all staged trees representing the same causal model. The technology we develop here, illustrated through a simple example, enables us to search for a variety of complex manipulations in large systems accurately and efficiently.},

We then consider finite-sample data as input, and propose the first constraint optimization approach for recovering the system timescale causal structure. This algorithm optimally recovers from possible conflicts due to statistical errors.

We address the problem of learning parameters of hybrid time models from complete data where all the states are known at any time point, and from incomplete trajectories, where continuous-time variables are observed only at some time points. We show that for the complete case, the parameters can be estimated straightforwardly. When some continuous-time variables are (partially) unobserved, it becomes infeasible to learn the parameters in closed form. In that case, we propose to use Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the posterior distribution over the parameters.

pages = {380-391},
abstract = {Bayesian networks, and especially their structures, are powerful tools for representing conditional independencies and dependencies between random variables. In applications where related variables form \emph{a priori} known groups, chosen to represent different ``views'' to or aspects of the same entities, one may be more interested in modeling dependencies between groups of variables rather than between individual variables. Motivated by this, we study prospects of representing relationships between variable groups using Bayesian network structures. We show that for dependency structures between groups to be expressible exactly, the data have to satisfy the so-called groupwise faithfulness assumption. We also show that one cannot learn causal relations between groups using only groupwise conditional independencies, but also variable-wise relations are needed. Additionally, we present algorithms for finding the groupwise dependency structures.},

pages = {392-402},
abstract = {We introduce a new family of mixed graphical models that consists of graphs with possibly directed, undirected and bidirected edges but without directed cycles. Moreover, there can be up to three edges between any pair of nodes. The new family includes Richardson's acyclic directed mixed graphs, as well as Andersson-Madigan-Perlman chain graphs. These features imply that no family of mixed graphical models that we know of subsumes the new models. We also provide a causal interpretation of the new models as systems of structural equations with correlated errors. Finally, we describe an exact algorithm for learning the new models from observational and interventional data via answer set programming.},

We present question selection methods for CAT for this generic model. We use three different types of models, Item Response Theory, Bayesian Networks, and Neural Networks, that instantiate the generic model. We illustrate the usefulness of a special model condition -- the monotonicity -- and discuss its inclusion in these model types. With Bayesian networks we use specific type of learning using generalized linear models to ensure the monotonicity. We conducted simulated CAT tests on empirical data. Behavior of individual models was assessed based on these tests. The best performing model was the BN model constructed by a domain expert its parameters were learned from data under the monotonicity condition.},

We propose scalable solutions based on hill climbing and simulated annealing, built on the Apache Flink framework for big data processing. We analyze the scalability of the solution through a series of experiments on large synthetic networks.},

In this paper we present a number of results that can be used to assess both the importance of a reliable likelihood-ratio estimate and the impact of neglecting dependencies among pieces of evidence for the purpose of evidence evaluation. We analytically study the effect of changes in dependencies between pieces of evidence on the likelihood ratio, and provide both theoretical and empirical bounds on the error in likelihood occasioned by assuming independences that do not hold in practice. In addition, a simple measure of influence strength between pieces of evidence is proposed.},

title = {An Empirical-{B}ayes Score for Discrete {B}ayesian Networks},
author = {Scutari, Marco},
pages = {438-448},
abstract = {Bayesian network structure learning is often performed in a Bayesian setting, by evaluating candidate structures using their posterior probabilities for a given data set. Score-based algorithms then use those posterior probabilities as an objective function and return the \emph{maximum a posteriori} network as the learned model. For discrete Bayesian networks, the canonical choice for a posterior score is the Bayesian Dirichlet equivalent uniform (BDeu) marginal likelihood with a uniform (U) graph prior (Heckerman et al., 1995). Its favourable theoretical properties descend from assuming a uniform prior both on the space of the network structures and on the space of the parameters of the network. In this paper, we revisit the limitations of these assumptions and we introduce an alternative set of assumptions and the resulting score: the Bayesian Dirichlet sparse (BDs) empirical Bayes marginal likelihood with a marginal uniform (MU) graph prior. We evaluate its performance in an extensive simulation study, showing that MU+BDs is more accurate than U+BDeu both in learning the structure of the network and in predicting new observations, while not being computationally more complex to estimate.},

pages = {449-461},
abstract = {Under-reporting occurs in survey data when there is a reason to systematically misreport the response to a question. For example, in studies dealing with low birth weight infants, the smoking habits of the mother are very likely to be misreported. This creates problems for calculating effect sizes, such as bias, but these problems are commonly ignored due to lack of generally accepted solutions. We reinterpret this as a problem of learning from missing data, and particularly learning from positive and unlabelled data. By this formalisation we provide a simple method to incorporate prior knowledge of the misreporting and we present how we can use this knowledge to derive corrected point and interval estimates of the mutual information. Then we show how our corrected estimators outperform more complex approaches and we present applications of our theoretical results in real world problems and machine learning tasks.},

abstract = {The concept of dependence among variables in a Bayesian belief network is well understood, but what does it mean in an influence diagram where some of those variables are decisions? 		There are three quite different answers to this question that take the familiar concepts for uncertain variables and extend them to decisions. 		First is responsiveness, whether the choice for a decision affects another variable. 		Second is materiality, whether observing other variables before making a decision affects the choice for the decision and thus improves its quality. 		Third is the usual notion of dependence, assuming that all of the decisions are made optimally given the information available at the time of the decisions. 		There are some subtleties involved, but all three types of decision dependence can be quite useful for understanding a decision model.},

Examples of such classes are discrete networks, conditional linear Gaussian networks, networks using mixtures of truncated exponentials, and networks with densities expressed as truncated polynomials. This paper defines another class with exact inference, based on the normal inverse gamma conjugacy. We describe the theory of this class as well as exemplify our implemented inference algorithm in a practical example. Although generally small and simple, we believe these kinds of networks are potentially quite useful, on their own or in combination with other algorithms and methods for Bayesian Network inference.},

author = {Sokolova, Elena and Hoogman, Martine and Groot, Perry and Claassen, Tom and Heskes, Tom},
pages = {487-498},
abstract = {Causal discovery provides an opportunity to infer causal relationships from purely observational data and to predict the effect of interventions. Constraint-based methods for causal discovery exploit conditional (in)dependencies to infer the direction of causal relationships. They typically work through forward chaining: given some causal statements, others can be inferred by applying relatively straightforward causal logic such as transitivity and acyclicity. Starting from the premise that we can estimate reliabilities for base causal statements, we propose a novel approach to estimate the reliability of novel statements inferred by forward chaining. Since reliabilities for base statements are clearly dependent, if only because inferred from the same data, exact computation is infeasible. However, lending ideas from the area of imprecise probability theory, we can compute bounds on the reliabilities on inferred statements. Specifically, we make use of the good old Fr\'{e}chet inequalities and discuss two different variants: greedy and delayed. In simulation experiments, we show that the delayed variant, at the expense of more bookkeeping and computation time, does provide slightly tighter intervals. We illustrate our method on a real-world data set about attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.},

We intend to represent decomposable models by special zero-one vectors, named {\em characteristic imsets}. Our approach leads to the study of a special polytope, defined as the convex hull of all characteristic imsets for chordal graphs, named the {\em chordal graph polytope}. We introduce a class of {\em clutter} inequalities and show that all of them are valid for (the vectors in) the polytope. In fact, these inequalities are even facet-defining for the polytope and we dare to conjecture that they lead to a complete polyhedral description of the polytope. Finally, we propose an LP method to solve the {\em separation problem} with these inequalities for use in a cutting plane approach.},

author = {Sundararajan, Priya Krishnan and Mengshoel, Ole J.},
pages = {511-522},
abstract = {Expectation maximization (EM) is a popular algorithm for parameter estimation in situations with incomplete data. The EM algorithm has, despite its popularity, the disadvantage of often converging to local but non-global optima. Several techniques have been proposed to address this problem, for example initializing EM from multiple random starting points and then selecting the run with the highest likelihood. Unfortunately, this method is computationally expensive. In this paper, our goal is to reduce computational cost while at the same time maximizing likelihood. We propose a Genetic Algorithm for Expectation Maximization (GAEM) for learning parameters in Bayesian networks. GAEM combines the global search property of a genetic algorithm with the local search property of EM. We prove GAEM's global convergence theoretically. Experimentally, we show that GAEM provides significant speed-ups since it tends to select more fit individuals, which converge faster, as parents for the next generation. Specifically, GAEM converges $1.5$ to $7$ times faster while producing better log-likelihood scores than the traditional EM algorithm.},

First, we estimate a Markov blanket of the class variable to reduce the set of features. Next, we use a heuristic to partition the set of features in the Markov blanket into those that are assigned to the LR part, and those that are assigned to the NB part of the hybrid model. The heuristic is based on reducing the conditional dependence of the features in NB part of the hybrid model given the class variable. We implement our method on 21 different classification datasets, and we compare the prediction accuracy of hybrid models with those of pure LR and pure NB models.},

A conditional probability table (CPT) in a BN often behaves as if there is a persistent leaky cause (PLC). We discuss limitations for not modeling PLC explicitly during compression. We also reveal challenges if PLC is explicitly modeled. We extend an earlier solution that is limited to binary NAT models and is incomplete, to a solution that is applicable to multi-valued NAT models and is complete. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution experimentally for compressing general BN CPTs with PLCs.},
