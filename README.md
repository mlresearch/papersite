# PMLR Generation Code

Code for generation of the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research.

There are two parts to this code,

1. an elegant [framework written in Haskell](https://github.com/mlresearch/papersite/blob/master/haskell/README.md) for releasing the original proceedings mainly written by Mark.
2. a hacky framework written in Ruby for releasing the updated PMLR proceedings mainly written by Neil.

For creation of new proceedings please check the [Ruby Framework](https://github.com/mlresearch/papersite/blob/master/ruby/README.md)
