  abstract = {This paper presents a combination of strategies for conversion rate (CVR) prediction de-
	ployed at the Yahoo! demand side platform (DSP) Brightroll, targeting at modeling 
	extremely high dimensional, sparse data with limited human intervention. We propose a
	novel probabilistic generative model by tightly integrating components of natural language
	processing, dynamic transfer learning and scalable prediction, named Dynamic Transfer
	Learning with Reinforced Word Modeling (a.k.a. Trans-RWM ) to predict user 
	conversion rates. Our model is based on assumptions that: on a higher level, information can
	be transferable between related campaigns; on a lower level, users who searched similar
	contents or browsed similar pages would have a higher probability of sharing similar latent
	purchase interests. Novelties of this framework include (i) A novel natural language
	 modeling specifically tailored for semantic inputs of CVR prediction; (ii) A Bayesian transfer
	learning model to dynamically transfer the knowledge from source to the future target;
	(iii) An automatic new updating rule with adaptive regularization using Stochastic 
	Gradient Monte Carlo to support the efficient updating of Trans-RWM in high-dimensional and
	sparse data. We demonstrate that on Brightroll our framework can effectively discriminate
	extremely rare events in terms of their conversion propensity.},
