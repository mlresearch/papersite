  abstract = {Look-alike audience extension is a practically effective way to customize high-performance
	audience in on-line advertising. With look-alike audience extension system, any advertiser
	can easily generate a set of customized audience by just providing a list of existing customers
	without knowing the detailed targetable attributes in a sophisticated advertising system.
	In this paper, we present our newly developed graph-based look-alike system in Yahoo!
	advertising platform which provides look-alike audiences for thousands of campaigns. 
	Extensive experiments have been conducted to compare our look-alike model with three other
	existing look-alike systems using billions of users and millions of user features. The
	 experiment results show that our developed graph-based method with nearest-neighbor filtering
	outperforms other methods by more than 50\% regarding conversion rate in app-install ad
	campaigns.},
