  abstract = {During the past decade, Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) and
Probabilistic Inductive Logic Programming (PILP), owing to their
strength in capturing structure information, have attracted much
attention for learning relational models such as weighted logic
rules. Typically, a generative model is assumed for the structured
joint distribution, and the learning process is accomplished in an
enormous relational space. In this paper, we propose a new framework,
i.e., Statistical Unfolded Logic (SUL) learning. In contrast to
learning rules in the relational space directly, SUL propositionalizes
the structure information into an attribute-value data set, and thus,
statistical discriminative learning which is much more efficient than
generative relational learning can be executed. In addition to
achieving better generalization performance, SUL is able to conduct
predicate invention that is hard to be realized by traditional SRL and
PILP approaches. Experiments on real tasks show that our proposed
approach is superior to state-of-the-art weighted rules learning
approaches.},
