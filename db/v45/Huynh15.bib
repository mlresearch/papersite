  abstract = {Bayesian nonparametric models are theoretically suitable to learn
streaming data due to their complexity relaxation to the volume of
observed data. However, most of the existing variational inference
algorithms are not applicable to streaming applications since they
require truncation on variational distributions. In this paper, we
present two truncation-free variational algorithms, one for mix-membership
inference called TFVB (truncation-free variational Bayes), and the
other for hard clustering inference called TFME (truncation-free maximization
expectation). With these algorithms, we further developed a streaming
learning framework for the popular Dirichlet process mixture (DPM)
models. Our experiments demonstrate the usefulness of our framework
in both synthetic and real-world data.},
