  abstract = {In this paper we study statistical consistency of partial losses suitable for
  learning structured output predictors from examples containing missing
  labels. We provide sufficient conditions on data generating distribution which
  admit to prove that the expected risk of the structured predictor learned by
  minimizing the partial loss converges to the optimal Bayes risk defined by an
  associated complete loss. We define a concept of surrogate classification
  calibrated partial losses which are easier to optimize yet their minimization
  preserves the statistical consistency. We give some concrete examples of
  surrogate partial losses which are classification calibrated. In particular,
  we show that the ramp-loss which is in the core of many existing algorithms 
  is classification calibrated.},
