  abstract = {This paper studies how machine learning techniques can facilitate the
detection of accounting fraud in publicly traded US firms.
Existing studies often mimic human experts and employ the
financial or nonfinancial ratios as the features for their
systems. We depart from these studies by adopting raw
accounting variables, which are directly available from a firm's
financial statement and thereby can be easily applied to new firms
at low cost. Further, we collected the most complete fraud dataset
of US publicly traded firms and labeled the fraud and non-fraud
firm-years. One key issue of the dataset is that the data is
extremely imbalanced, in which the fraud firm-years are often less
than one percent. Without re-sampling the data, we further propose
to tackle the imbalance issue by adopting the techniques of
imbalanced learning. In particular, we employ the linear and
nonlinear Biased Penalty Support Vector Machine and the Ensemble Methods, both of
which have been proved to successfully handle the imbalance issue
in the machine learning literatures. We finally evaluate our approach
by conducting extensive empirical studies. Empirical results show
that the proposed schema can achieve much better
performance, in terms of balanced accuracy, than the state of the
art. Besides the performance, our approaches can also compute very
fast, which further supports their practical deployment.},
