  abstract = {A \emph{preference relation}-based Top-N recommendation approach, 
	\emph{PrefMRF}, is proposed to capture both the second-order and 
	the higher-order interactions among users and items. 
	Traditionally Top-N recommendation was achieved by predicting 
	the item ratings first, and then inferring the item rankings, 
	based on the assumption of availability of \emph{explicit} feedbacks 
	such as ratings, and the assumption that optimizing the ratings 
	is equivalent to optimizing the item rankings. 
	Nevertheless, both assumptions are not always true in real 
	world applications. The proposed \emph{PrefMRF} approach drops these 
	assumptions by explicitly exploiting the preference relations, 
	a more practical user feedback. 
	Comparing to related work, the proposed \emph{PrefMRF} approach has 
	the unique property of modeling both the second-order and the 
	higher-order interactions among users and items.
	To the best of our knowledge,
	this is the first time both types of interactions
	have been captured in \emph{preference relation}-based method.
	Experiment results on public datasets demonstrate that both 
	types of interactions have been properly captured, 
	and significantly improved Top-N recommendation performance 
	has been achieved.},
