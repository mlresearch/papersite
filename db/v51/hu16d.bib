  abstract = {We present a scalable probabilistic framework for learning from multi-relational data given in form of entity-relation-entity triplets, with a potentially massive number of entities and relations (e.g., in multi-relational networks, knowledge bases, etc.). We define each triplet via a relation-specific bilinear function of the embeddings  of entities associated with it (these embeddings correspond to ``topics''). To handle massive number of relations and the data sparsity problem (very few observations per relation), we also extend this model to allow sharing of parameters across relations, which leads to a substantial reduction in the number of parameters to be learned. In addition to yielding excellent predictive performance (e.g., for knowledge base completion tasks), the interpretability of our topic-based embedding framework enables easy qualitative analyses. Computational cost of our models scales in the number of positive triplets, which makes it easy to scale to massive real-world multi-relational data sets, which are usually extremely sparse. We develop simple-to-implement batch as well as online Gibbs sampling algorithms and demonstrate the effectiveness of our models on tasks such as multi-relational link-prediction, and learning from large knowledge bases.},
