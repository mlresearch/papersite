  abstract = {In Bipartite Correlation Clustering (BCC)  we are given a complete bipartite graph $G$ with '+' and '-' edges, and we seek a vertex clustering that maximizes the number of agreements: the number of all '+' edges within clusters plus all '-' edges cut across clusters. BCC is known to be NP-hard [5].  We present a novel approximation algorithm for $k$-BCC, a variant of BCC with an upper bound $k$ on the number of clusters. Our algorithm outputs a $k$-clustering that provably achieves a number of agreements within a multiplicative $(1-\delta)$-factor from the optimal, for any desired accuracy $\delta$. It relies on solving a combinatorially constrained bilinear maximization on the bi-adjacency matrix of $G$. It runs in time exponential in $k$ and $1/\delta$, but linear in the size of the input.  Further, we show that, in the (unconstrained) BCC setting, an $(1-\delta)$-approximation can be achieved by $O(1/\delta)$ clusters regardless of the size of the graph. In turn, our $k$-BCC algorithm implies an Efficient PTAS for the BCC objective of maximizing agreements.},
