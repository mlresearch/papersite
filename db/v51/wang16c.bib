  abstract = {A deep Gaussian process (DGP) is a deep network in which each layer is modelled with a Gaussian process (GP). It is a flexible model that can capture highly-nonlinear functions for complex data sets. However, the network structure of DGP often makes inference computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose an efficient sequential inference framework for DGP, where the data is processed sequentially. We also propose two DGP extensions to handle heteroscedasticity and multi-task learning. Our experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of  our sequential inference framework on a number of important learning tasks.},
