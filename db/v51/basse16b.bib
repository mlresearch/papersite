  abstract = {Buyers (e.g., advertisers) often have limited financial or   processing resources, and so their participation in auctions is   throttled. Changes to auctions may affect bids or throttling, and   any change may affect what buyers pay. This paper shows that if an   A/B experiment affects only bids, then the observed treatment effect   is an unbiased estimator when all the bidders in the same auction   are randomly assigned to A or B but the observed treatment effect   can be severely biased otherwise, even in the absence of   throttling. Experiments that affect throttling algorithms can also   be badly biased, but the bias can be much reduced if separate   budgets are maintained for the A and B arms of the experiment.},
