  abstract = {Robust tensor CP decomposition involves decomposing  a tensor into low rank and sparse components. We propose a novel non-convex iterative algorithm with guaranteed recovery.  It alternates  between  low-rank CP decomposition through gradient ascent (a variant of the tensor power method), and  hard thresholding of the residual. We prove convergence to the globally optimal solution   under natural incoherence conditions on the low rank component, and bounded level of sparse perturbations. We compare our method with natural baselines, which apply robust  matrix PCA either to the {\em flattened} tensor, or to the matrix slices of the tensor. Our method can provably handle a far greater level of perturbation  when the sparse  tensor is  block-structured. This naturally occurs in many applications such as  the foreground-background separation task in videos. Our experiments validate these findings. Thus, we establish that tensor methods can tolerate  a higher level of gross corruptions compared to matrix methods.},
