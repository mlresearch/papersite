  abstract = {A formidable challenge in uncertainty modeling in general, and when learning Bayesian networks in particular, is the discovery of  unknown hidden variables. Few works that tackle this task are typically limited to discrete or Gaussian domains, or to tree structures.  We propose a novel general purpose approach for discovering hidden variables in flexible non-Gaussian domains using the powerful class of  Gaussian copula networks. Briefly, we define the concept of a hypothetically optimal predictor of variable and  show it can be used to discover  useful hidden variables in the  expressive framework of copula networks.  Our approach leads to  performance and compactness advantages  over competitors in a variety of domains.},
