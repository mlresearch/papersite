  abstract = {We study the problem of decomposing a multivariate probability distribution $p(\mathbf{v})$ defined over a set of random variables $\mathbf{V}=\{V_1,\dots,V_n\}$ into a product of factors defined over disjoint subsets $\{\mathbf{V}_{F_1},\dots,\mathbf{V}_{F_m}\}$. We show that the decomposition of $\mathbf{V}$ into irreducible disjoint factors forms a unique partition, which corresponds to the connected components of a Bayesian or Markov network, given that it is faithful to $p$. Finally, we provide three generic procedures to identify these factors with $O(n^2)$ pairwise conditional independence tests ($V_i\perp V_j {\mathbin{\mid}}\mathbf{Z}$) under much less restrictive assumptions: 1) $p$ supports the Intersection property ii) $p$ supports the Composition property iii) no assumption at all.},
