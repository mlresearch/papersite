  abstract = {We propose an extended Bayesian matrix factorization method, which can incorporate multiple sources of side information, combine multiple \emph{a priori} estimates for the missing data and integrates a flexible missing not at random submodel. The model is formalized as probabilistic graphical model and a corresponding Gibbs sampling scheme is derived to perform unrestricted inference. We discuss the application of the method for completing drug--target interaction matrices, also discussing specialties in this domain. Using real-world drug--target interaction data, the performance of the method is compared against both a general Bayesian matrix factorization method and a specific one developed for drug--target interaction prediction. Results demonstrate the advantages of the extended model.},
