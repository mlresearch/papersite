  abstract = {This theoretical paper is inspired by an {\em integer linear programming} (ILP) approach to learning the structure of {\em decomposable models}. We intend to represent decomposable models by special zero-one vectors, named {\em characteristic imsets}. Our approach leads to the study of a special polytope, defined as the convex hull of all characteristic imsets for chordal graphs, named the {\em chordal graph polytope}. We introduce a class of {\em clutter} inequalities and show that all of them are valid for (the vectors in) the polytope. In fact, these inequalities are even facet-defining for the polytope and we dare to conjecture that they lead to a complete polyhedral description of the polytope. Finally, we propose an LP method to solve the {\em separation problem} with these inequalities for use in a cutting plane approach.},
