  abstract = {Assessing the probability of occurrence of extreme events  is a crucial issue in various fields like finance, insurance, telecommunication or environmental sciences. In a multivariate framework, the tail dependence is characterized by the so-called \emph{stable tail dependence function} (\textsc{stdf}). Learning this structure is the keystone of multivariate extremes. Although extensive studies have proved consistency and asymptotic normality for the empirical version of the \textsc{stdf}, non-asymptotic bounds are still missing. The main purpose of this paper is to fill this gap. Taking advantage of adapted VC-type concentration inequalities, upper bounds are derived with expected rate of convergence in $O(k^{-1/2})$. The concentration tools involved in this analysis rely on a more general study of maximal deviations in low probability regions, and thus directly apply to the classification of extreme data. },
