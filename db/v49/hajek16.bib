  abstract = {We study a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation of the maximum likelihood estimation
for exactly recovering a hidden community of cardinality $K$ from an $n \times n$ symmetric
data matrix $A$, where for distinct indices $i,j$, $A_{ij} \sim P$ if $i, j$ are both in the community and
$A_{ij} \sim Q$ otherwise, for two known probability distributions $P$ and $Q$.
We identify a  sufficient
condition  and a  necessary condition for the success of SDP  for the general model.
For both the Bernoulli case ($P={{\rm Bern}}(p)$ and $Q={{\rm Bern}}(q)$ with $p>q$) and the Gaussian case
($P=\mathcal{N}(\mu,1)$ and $Q=\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ with $\mu>0$),
which correspond to the problem of planted dense subgraph recovery and submatrix
localization respectively,
the general results lead to the following
findings: (1) If $K=\omega( n /\log n)$, SDP attains the information-theoretic recovery limits
with sharp constants; (2) If $K=\Theta(n/\log n)$, SDP is order-wise optimal, but strictly
suboptimal by a constant factor; (3) If $K=o(n/\log n)$ and $K \to \infty$, SDP is order-wise suboptimal.
The same critical scaling for $K$ is found to hold, up to constant factors, for the performance of SDP on the stochastic block model of $n$ vertices partitioned into multiple communities of equal size $K$. A key ingredient in the proof of the necessary condition is a construction of a primal feasible solution based on
random perturbation of the true cluster matrix.
