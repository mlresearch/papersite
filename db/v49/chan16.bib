  abstract = {It is well known that Sparse PCA (Sparse Principal Component Analysis) is NP-hard to solve exactly on worst-case instances.
What is the complexity of solving Sparse PCA approximately?
Our contributions include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item a simple and efficient algorithm that achieves an $n^{-1/3}$-approximation;
\item NP-hardness of approximation to within $(1-\varepsilon)$, for some small constant $\varepsilon > 0$;
\item SSE-hardness of approximation to within {\em any} constant factor; and
\item an $\exp\exp\left(\Omega\left(\sqrt{\log \log n}\right)\right)$ (``quasi-quasi-polynomial'') gap for the standard semidefinite program.
\end{enumerate}},
