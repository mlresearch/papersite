  abstract = {Bias reduction is an important condition for effective feature extraction. Utilizing recent theoretical results in high dimensional statistical modeling, we propose a model-free yet computationally simple approach to estimate the partially linear model $Y=X\beta+g(Z)+\varepsilon$. Based on partitioning the support of $Z$, a simple local average is used to  approximate the response surface $g(Z)$. The model can be estimated via least squares and no tuning parameter is needed. The proposed method seeks to strike a balance between computation
burden and efficiency of the estimators while minimizing model bias. The desired theoretical properties of the proposed estimators are established.  Moreover, since the proposed method bypasses data-driven bandwith selection of traditional nonparametric methods, it avoids the further efficiency loss due to computation burden.},
