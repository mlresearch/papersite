  abstract = {Deep learning provides a natural way to obtain feature representations from data without relying on hand-crafted descriptors. In this paper, we propose to learn deep feature representations using unsupervised and supervised learning in a cascaded fashion to produce generically descriptive yet class specic features. The proposed method can take full advantage of the availability of large-scale unlabeled data and learn discriminative features (supervised) from generic features (unsupervised). It is then applied to multiple essential facial regions to obtain multi-channel deep facial representations for face recognition. The effecacy of the proposed feature representations is validated on both controlled (i.e., extended Yale- B, Yale, and AR) and uncontrolled (PubFig) benchmark face databases. Experimental results show its effectiveness.},
