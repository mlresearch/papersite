  abstract = {The Sequence PredIction ChallengE (SPiCe) is an on-line competition that took place between March and July 2016. Each of the 15 problems was made of a set of whole sequences as training sample, a validation set of prefixes, and a test set of prefixes. The aim was to submit a ranking of the 5 most probable symbols to be the next symbol of each prefix.},
