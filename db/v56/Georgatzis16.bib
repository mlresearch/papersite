  abstract = {We present a non-linear dynamical system for modelling the effect of  drug infusions on the vital signs of patients admitted in Intensive  Care Units (ICUs). More specifically we are interested in modelling  the effect of a widely used anaesthetic drug (Propofol) on a patient's  monitored depth of anaesthesia and haemodynamics. We compare our  approach with one from the Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD)  literature and show that we can provide significant improvements in  performance without requiring the incorporation of expert  physiological knowledge in our system.},
