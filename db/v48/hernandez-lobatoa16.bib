  abstract = {We present {\small PESMO}, a Bayesian method for identifying the Pareto set of multi-objective optimization problems, when the functions are expensive to evaluate. {\small PESMO} chooses the evaluation points to maximally reduce the entropy of the posterior distribution over the Pareto set. The {\small PESMO} acquisition function is decomposed as a sum of objective-specific acquisition functions, which makes it possible to use the algorithm in \emph{decoupled} scenarios in which the objectives can be evaluated separately and perhaps with different costs. This decoupling capability is useful to identify difficult objectives that require more evaluations. {\small PESMO} also offers gains in efficiency, as its cost scales linearly with the number of objectives, in comparison to the exponential cost of other methods. We compare {\small PESMO} with other methods on synthetic and real-world problems. The results show that {\small PESMO} produces better recommendations with a smaller number of evaluations, and that a decoupled evaluation can lead to improvements in performance, particularly when the number of objectives is large.},
